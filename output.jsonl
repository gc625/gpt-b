{"prompt": ["[class2023] From the President: MLK Day and Creating a Beloved Community"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nThe College will be closed Monday in observance of the national holiday\r\ncommemorating the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the great social movement that Dr. King led is the concept\r\nof \u201ca beloved community,\u201d a society free from racial oppression and\r\nsystemic injustice. King acknowledged that achieving that vision of radical\r\nlove would require, as he put it, \u201ca qualitative change in our souls as\r\nwell as a quantitative change in our lives.\" In the more than half century\r\nsince his death, we have seen many incremental changes in our society and\r\nyet, as the turmoil of our current democratic moment demonstrates, there is\r\nstill much more work to be done.\r\n\r\nMonday\u2019s holiday is an opportunity not just to reflect on that critical\r\nwork but also to do more of it. And in that spirit, the King Center for\r\nNonviolent Social Change in Atlanta has chosen a theme for this year,\r\nasking us to begin cultivating a beloved community mindset to address and\r\ntransform unjust systems.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what we are striving to do here at Conn through our\r\ncommitment to full participation. And so, as part of our work together this\r\nyear, we will welcome for the 2023 MLK Lecture Dr. Justin Rose, a King\r\nscholar, professor of political science and dean for Faculty Recruitment,\r\nDevelopment, and Diversity at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. Prior\r\nto joining Rhodes, Rose served on the political science faculty and\r\nco-directed the Africana Studies program at Hobart and William Smith\r\nColleges. Most recently, he was a fellow in the Office of Diversity,\r\nInclusion, and Belonging at the Harvard Kennedy School. His lecture will\r\ntake place via Zoom at 7 p.m. on Jan. 30. We hope you will join us.\r\n\r\nTo extend the conversation, Rodmon King, dean of Institutional Equity and\r\nInclusion, and Reginald White, vice president for Human Resources, will\r\nlaunch an initiative this semester focused on cultivating a beloved\r\ncommunity mindset on our campus. This series of convenings and workshops,\r\nwhich is expected to continue through next fall, will begin at 4 p.m.,\r\nFriday, Feb. 10, 2023, in the 1941 Room in Crozier-Williams.\r\n\r\nLater that evening on Feb. 10 at the Athey Center for Performance and\r\nResearch, celebrated choreographer and dancer Ronald K. Brown and his\r\ncompany Evidence will perform a new work, \u201cThe Equality of Night and Day\u201d\r\n, which examines concepts of equity and fairness in a world of\r\nincreasing exploitation, gentrification, racism and xenophobia.\r\n\r\nTogether, these events will mark the start of our third annual Elevate\r\nconference, designed to bring together committed students, staff, faculty,\r\nalumni and residents of the New London region for listening and dialogue on\r\nracial justice. In 2021 and 2022, the Elevate conference was virtual. This\r\nyear, it will be in person and on campus, starting with the workshop on\r\nFeb. 10 and continuing the next day with a series of talks and discussions\r\non Feb. 11. More information about times and locations will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nOur mission at Connecticut College is to create productive citizens\r\nprepared to put their education into action in support of a global\r\ndemocracy. That means working to elevate our discourse, our practices and\r\nour forms of self-governance to create the kind of environment where all\r\npeople, no matter their identity or background, have the opportunity to\r\nthrive, to reach their potential and to contribute meaningfully to the\r\nflourishing of their communities and of the world. That ideal, called full\r\nparticipation, lies at the heart of who we are and what we do. On Monday,\r\nas you reflect on the legacy of Dr. King, please consider how you can do\r\nyour part in creating our beloved community.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] From the President: Lee Hisle's Retirement"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nI am writing to share the bittersweet news that Lee Hisle, Vice President\r\nfor Information Services and Librarian of the College, will retire at the\r\nend of the academic year after more than 23 years at Connecticut College.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Conn\u2019s chief information officer, Lee has been an invaluable presence on\r\nthe senior administrative team, overseeing all libraries, instructional\r\ntechnology, administrative systems, networks and telecommunications during\r\na period of great technological change. Since arriving in New London in\r\nJanuary 2000, he has helped Connecticut College significantly advance its\r\ninformation resources and technology infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLee has brought vision, strategic planning and effective administration to\r\nthe division, manifested in the award-winning transformation of the Charles\r\nE. Shain Library into a 21st-century facility. Under his leadership, the\r\nCollege moved to a digital-first environment, implementing countless new\r\nsystems, including the ExLibris Library System, the Bepress Digital Commons\r\nrepository, the Digital Scholarship and Curriculum Center, Solarwinds\r\nWebHelpDesk, Salesforce for Advancement, Slate for Admissions, Google\r\nWorkspace for Education and, most recently, the move of Banner and other\r\nenterprise technology  to the cloud. He was also instrumental in\r\nestablishing three iconic spaces within Shain: the Linda Lear Center for\r\nSpecial Collections and Archives, the Charles Chu Reading Room and the Blue\r\nCamel Cafe.\r\n\r\nDeveloping excellent systems, staff, and practices to support Connecticut\r\nCollege\u2019s students, faculty and staff has been one of Lee\u2019s great\r\nstrengths. His approach to data security is a case in point. The response\r\nof his division to the COVID pandemic is another\u2014and a point worth\r\nunderscoring. We will always be grateful for the way the IS staff worked to\r\nkeep the College operating through the infrastructure and training they\r\noffered in alternative hybrid and remote teaching methodologies, while\r\nsupporting new  information delivery strategies and even a COVID testing\r\ncenter. Of Lee\u2019s many achievements, he is perhaps most proud of hiring and\r\ndeveloping the outstanding team of information and instructional\r\ntechnologists and librarians we have today.\r\n\r\nIn January, we will begin the process of identifying Lee\u2019s successor.\r\nDanielle Egan, Dean of the Faculty, will serve as a co-chair of the search\r\ncommittee. We will announce the full committee and other information about\r\nthe search as it becomes available. Later this spring, of course, there\r\nwill be occasions to recognize Lee\u2019s many contributions to Connecticut\r\nCollege. For now, please join me in thanking him for more than two decades\r\nof  exemplary leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] From the President: Next President's Distinguished Lecture"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nI am writing to invite you to our next President\u2019s Distinguished Lecture\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/meet-our-president/presidents-distinguished-lecture-series/>\r\nwith acclaimed environmental writer Elizabeth Rush. She will be speaking at\r\n7 p.m. on April 10 at the Athey Center for Performance and Research at\r\nPalmer Auditorium.\r\n\r\n\r\nRush is the author of *The Quickening: On Motherhood and Antarctica in the\r\nTwenty First Century* and *Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore*,\r\na finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. She is one of the leading voices in the\r\nglobal conversation about climate change, sea level rise and the resulting\r\nimpacts on our lives, our communities and our planet. Her writing is\r\nelegant, haunting, rigorously reported and deeply intelligent. It sheds new\r\nlight on the human condition and our capacity for hope and our ability to\r\nimagine and thrive in a world transformed by climate change.\r\n\r\nCentral to Rush\u2019s writing practice is the act of listening: listening to\r\nthose who live in front-line communities transformed by the climate;\r\nlistening to Antarctica\u2019s great glaciers as they go to pieces; listening to\r\nall those voices long locked out of environmental conversations. Her work\r\nexplores fundamental questions: what does our broken world ask of us? How\r\ncan we continue to live and love while also losing much?\r\n\r\nRush spent many years reporting from coastal communities experiencing the\r\npressure of higher tides and stronger storms. In *Rising*, she weaves\r\ntogether her personal experience with first-hand testimonials of those\r\nliving on the front lines of climate change, guiding readers through some\r\nof the places where sea level rise is a reality.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Rush joined 57 scientists and crew onboard a research icebreaker\r\nfor months in Antarctica to learn about the Thwaites Glacier, nicknamed the\r\nDoomsday Glacier because of its instability and potential to make a\r\ncatastrophic impact on global sea-level rise this century. In *The\r\nQuickening*, Rush documents their voyage, offering sublime observations\r\nalongside the workaday moments of this groundbreaking expedition. Along the\r\nway, she takes readers on a personal journey around a more intimate\r\nquestion: What does it mean to bring a child into the world at this time of\r\nradical change?\r\n\r\nRush is the recipient of fellowships from the National Science Foundation,\r\nNational Geographic, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Howard Foundation, Andrew\r\nMellon Foundation and Metcalf Institute. She lives in Providence and\r\nteaches creative nonfiction at Brown University.\r\n\r\nHer visit to Connecticut College, organized in partnership with the Office\r\nof Sustainability, will include discussions with students earlier in the\r\nday in addition to the main event at 7 p.m. I look forward to seeing you\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

This approach is\r\ndesigned to promote equal access, address racial discrimination and create\r\nequitable and sustainable communities \u2014 both on campus and in the world\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nAs the Supreme Court considers the fate of race-conscious admissions in\r\nAmerica, the Connecticut College community urges the justices to remember\r\nthat civic development \u2014 and the future of our democratic society \u2014 depend\r\non the ways we educate ever more diverse communities of students to speak\r\npurposefully, listen deeply and collaborate effectively.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to monitor the Court\u2019s proceedings, I want to reassure you\r\nthat Conn remains committed to the principles of diversity, inclusion and\r\njustice in our admissions and other policies as we address the weight of\r\npast legacies and current challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

In this culminating\r\nConnections event, 240 seniors in our pathways, centers and certificate\r\nprograms will present the results of their work over the past three years.\r\n\r\nThrough talks, panels and poster sessions, our student presenters will\r\nhighlight the connections they have made among their courses and research,\r\ntheir jobs and internships, and their work in local communities and around\r\nthe globe\u2014along with the questions that animated their choices along the\r\nway. The whole campus is encouraged to participate in this major student\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nYou will find more information on the Symposium website\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/connections/all-college-symposium/>, where you\r\ncan peruse the schedule and locate instructions for downloading the\r\nGuidebook <https://guidebook.com/g/#/guides/2022ccsymposium/details> app on\r\nyour mobile device.

Inspired by\r\nthe creative energy of that inaugural event, then renewed by the resilience\r\nof those who presented entirely online in 2020, and invigorated by the\r\nbrilliance on display last year, this year\u2019s presenters have a unique\r\nperspective on Connections. They, too, have persevered in the midst of a\r\npandemic to benefit from an incredible range of experiences\u2014both in-person\r\nand remote\u2014leading to research discoveries; new works of art, music, film,\r\ntheater and dance; off-campus learning; and creative internships serving\r\nlocal and global communities.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] A Message from the President"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nToday marks the official opening of the new academic year. Please join me\r\nat 4:30 p.m. on Tempel Green for our 108th Convocation, when we will\r\nwelcome our newest colleagues: 22 new faculty; 75 new staff; and 655 new\r\nstudents who make up the largest and one of the most diverse and\r\nacademically talented incoming classes in our history. Rodmon King, dean of\r\nInstitutional Equity and Inclusion, will deliver the keynote address: \u201cThe\r\nChoice is Yours.\u201d An all-campus picnic will follow in Harris Refectory.\r\n\r\nThis new academic year comes at a time of both great challenge and great\r\npossibility in our nation and the world. The strength of Connecticut\r\nCollege has always been found in the bonds that unite us as a community,\r\nand this sense of unity and common purpose, together with a commitment to\r\ninnovation in every domain, encourages Conn faculty, staff, students, and\r\nalumni to make an even bigger difference with their lives by putting their\r\neducation into action. My letter today outlines the work we are doing to\r\nsupport this mission and to advance our strategic priorities.\r\n\r\n*Capital projects*\r\n\r\nSummer is often a time of campus renewal and the past few months have been\r\nthe busiest in recent memory. We undertook an array of critical projects to\r\nenhance teaching, learning, living, and sustainability. These include the\r\nrevitalization of our Thames River waterfront for greater accessibility;\r\nthe repurposing of Gallows Lane to support fieldwork in biology, botany,\r\nenvironmental studies and the Arboretum; the improvement of departmental\r\nteaching spaces in Bolles House; the creation of the Stark Center for the\r\nMoving Image in Hillyer Hall; and the upgrading of more than 30 classrooms\r\nacross campus.\r\n\r\nWe also made improvements to Horizon House, home to our Office of\r\nAdmission; redesigned residence hall bathrooms in Katharine Blunt House for\r\nenhanced privacy; refurbished the Natatorium and built new locker rooms for\r\nboth men\u2019s and women\u2019s ice hockey in Dayton Arena. Most critically, we\r\nworked closely with partners in New London to provide new opportunities for\r\napartment-style living in the heart of downtown at the Manwaring Building\r\non State Street\u2014a major milestone for the College.\r\n\r\nFinally, addressing our sustainability goals, we began the process of\r\nupgrading all LED lighting across campus; installed energy-efficient heat\r\npumps in the Service Building, Nichols House, and Strickland House;\r\ninvested in new bike racks and water bottle filling stations across campus;\r\nand, through the support of Student Government, expanded our partnership\r\nwith Generation Conscious to provide even more detergent strip dispensers\r\nfor student use.\r\n\r\nMany of these projects are now complete or nearing completion; a number are\r\nin progress and expected to be finished by the end of the semester. Still\r\nmore are now being planned for summer 2023. Among these, most notably, are\r\nthe renovations of Harris Refectory, the College Center at\r\nCrozier-Williams, and the landscape between them.\r\n\r\n*The year ahead*\r\nIn addition to improvements to our physical campus, our work for the coming\r\nyear will focus on assessment, shared governance, and long-term financial\r\nsustainability.\r\n\r\n*Assessment*\r\n\r\nThe College undergoes reaccreditation every 10 years through the New\r\nEngland Commission on Higher Education. 2023 will mark five years since our\r\nlast reaccreditation and, as such, we are preparing a mid-cycle report on\r\nprogress made since 2018 on our strategic plan, on Connections, and on the\r\nassessment of student learning. Dean of the Faculty Danielle Egan, Dean of\r\nStrategic and Global Initiatives Amy Dooling and Director of Institutional\r\nResearch John Nugent will be working with faculty, staff, and student\r\nleaders to finalize a report by February 2023. A report on the most recent\r\nprogress on our strategic plan can be found here\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/strategic-planning/progress-reports/2022-progress-report/>\r\n.\r\n\r\n*Shared governance*\r\n\r\nNo progress can be made without a strong commitment to shared governance.\r\nLast year, the Student Government Association  undertook a project to\r\nreview the College\u2019s 20-year-old Principles on Shared Governance to reflect\r\nnew expectations and practices, a project that culminated in the signing of\r\na revised covenant\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/honor-code-shared-governance/shared-governance-covenant/#:~:text=The%20Commission%20on%20Shared%20Governance,relationships%20among%20the%20governing%20bodies.>\r\nat a ceremony during the Board of Trustees meeting in April. Today, during\r\nour Convocation exercises, the Chair of the Board of Trustees, the new\r\nPresident of SGA, the new Chair of the Faculty Steering and Conference\r\nCommittee, the new Chair of Staff Council, and myself will sign the\r\ncovenant again to signal our continued commitment. And during the fall\r\nsemester, a new commission on shared governance, as outlined in the\r\ncovenant, will be convened to begin the process of assessing the\r\neffectiveness of our current systems and making recommendations for\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n*Financial sustainability*\r\n\r\nAmong the most critical of our shared endeavors is the financial wellbeing\r\nof the College. This summer, with the Executive Committee of the Board of\r\nTrustees, the senior leadership advanced its work on developing a more\r\nsustainable, nimble and robust business model for the next five years,\r\nincluding strategies to boost revenues and redirect operating expenses\r\ntoward the most critical priorities. That work will continue this semester\r\nwith the input of key governing bodies on campus, and the goal of\r\ncompleting the five-year model for Board discussion in February.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the Board of Trustees met to review year-end results for fiscal\r\nyear 2022, and, although the audit is still in progress, a balanced\r\ncash-operating budget fully anticipated. The Board also reviewed our budget\r\nfor the current fiscal year based on updated information about enrollment\r\nand expenses, and approved a revised budget for fiscal year 2023 of $101.5\r\nmillion. This new budget includes the full restoration of the College\r\ncontribution to the 403b retirement plan to 10 percent by Jan. 1.\r\n\r\n*Campaign*\r\n\r\nOur Defy Boundaries <https://defyboundaries.conncoll.edu/> campaign\r\ncontributes to the College\u2019s financial sustainability through annual giving\r\nand endowment. Our strategic plan foresees growing the Connecticut College\r\nendowment to $500 million by 2026, and this past summer, our endowment\r\nreached $435 million, an increase of 74 percent since the start of the\r\nplan. Last October, we launched the public phase of Defy Boundaries with\r\nthe announcement of its ambitious $300 million goal, and by June 30, we\r\nconcluded the year with the strongest year of fundraising on record\u2014a total\r\nof $56 million in new gifts and commitments. We expect to build on the\r\nmomentum in the year ahead as the campaign goes on the road with several\r\nregional events, taking the message to Camel alumni and parents across the\r\ncountry in our first in-person convenings since the start of the pandemic.\r\nIn five years\u2019 time, the Defy Boundaries campaign has raised a total of\r\n$240 million, and, with $60 million to go, is on track to reach its goal in\r\n2024.\r\n\r\n*New Senior Leadership*\r\n\r\nOn July 1, we welcomed Danielle Egan, Fuller-Matthai Professor and Chair of\r\nGender, Sexuality, and Intersectionality Studies, to her new role as Dean\r\nof the Faculty, succeeding Jeffrey Cole. In August, our vice president for\r\nFinance and Administration left the College for a new opportunity and\r\nTeresa Smith, an experienced financial leader in higher education, joined\r\nus to oversee the division on an interim basis. A search for the permanent\r\nvice president has already begun with the expectation of making an\r\nappointment by the end of the fall semester. I want to express my gratitude\r\nto Kimberly Verstandig, Vice President for Advancement, who will chair the\r\nsearch as well as to all the colleagues who have generously agreed to\r\nserve: Priya Kohli, Associate Professor of Statistics and Chair of PPBC;\r\nJohn Linehan, P \u201918, \u201923, 24, Chair of the Investment Committee of the\r\nBoard of Trustees; Laurie Schaeffer, Associate Chief Information Officer\r\nfor Enterprise Systems; Madeline Vanech \u201923, Senior Fellow in Admission and\r\nChair of Finance for SGA; Raj Vig,\u201993, Chair of the Finance Committee of\r\nthe Board; and Reginald White, Vice President for Human Resources. Lauren\r\nMiddleton, Secretary of the College, will staff the committee.\r\n\r\n*Forthcoming events*\r\n\r\nAs we launch the semester, please mark these important events in September:\r\n\r\n   - September 14: Our first faculty-staff meeting will take place at 4:15\r\n   p.m. outside on Chapel Green, with an outdoor picnic/reception immediately\r\n   following for all faculty and staff at 772 Williams Street.\r\n   - September 15: U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman , the former\r\n   top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, will share his\r\n   perspective on the Russia-Ukraine war at 7 p.m. in the Athey Center for\r\n   Performance and Research at Palmer Auditorium. The lecture is hosted by the\r\n   Sound Lab Foundation and Friends of the Connecticut College Library.\r\n   - September 21: A service of remembrance will be held in Harkness Chapel\r\n   at 4 p.m. to acknowledge those staff and faculty in our community who have\r\n   lost family members during the past two years.\r\n   - September 22: Disability rights activist Judith Heumann will discuss\r\n   her memoir, \u201cBeing Heumann,\u201d at 7 p.m. in the Athey Center for Performance\r\n   and Research at Palmer Auditorium.

What began as a local Texas tradition has grown into a nationwide\r\nobservance, now recognized as a federal holiday.\r\n\r\nThis year, Connecticut College will make Juneteenth an official holiday for\r\nConn employees. We will celebrate it on Monday, June 20. All administrative\r\noffices will be closed.\r\n\r\nWe want to encourage all of you to take this time to reflect on the meaning\r\nof the holiday, through readings, stories, food, music, and fellowship.\r\nThere are online resources to explore, including the National Museum\r\nAfrican American History and Culture\r\n<https://nmaahc.si.edu/juneteenth?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->\r\nand a series of virtual events hosted by the Black Heritage Trail NH\r\n<https://blackheritagetrailnh.org/2021-juneteenth-celebration/?gclid=CjwKCAjw4ayUBhA4EiwATWyBrntV8KGVT_FJy6uCT7khYE83lQhnxuUacvIZT2nW2Wa7fszxBCIM5xoCiMwQAvD_BwE&utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->.\r\nThere are also several local celebrations you can attend in person:\r\n\r\n   - June 10, 5:30 p.m. - Film Screening\r\n   <https://ctlandmarks.org/event/juneteenth-campfire-discussion-2/?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->\r\n   by If\u00e9 Franklin at the Opportunities Industrialization Center, New London\r\n   - June 11, 11 a.m. - 4 p.m. - New London Juneteenth Festival\r\n   <https://ctlandmarks.org/event/juneteenth-2022-festival/?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->,\r\n   Hempsted Houses, New London\r\n   - June 11, 12 p.m.  - 4 p.m. - Juneteenth Family Day\r\n   <https://www.amistadcenter.org/event-details/juneteenth-family-day?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->,\r\n   the Amistad Center, 600 Main Street, Hartford\r\n   - June 18, 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. - Juneteenth celebration\r\n   <https://www.facebook.com/events/4895663590489455?mc_cid=0207b45d19&mc_eid=b36ea6fcbf&utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->,\r\n   Burnt Hill Park, Hebron.\r\n   - June 18 -  West Haven Celebrates Juneteenth\r\n   <https://www.cityofwesthaven.com/DocumentCenter/View/4343/West-Haven-Celebrates-Juneteenth-Flyer-2022-JPEG?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->,\r\n   Brent Watt Park, West Haven\r\n   - Throughout June -  Several installation events sponsored by the  Witness\r\n   Stones\r\n   <https://witnessstonesproject.org/upcoming-events/?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->Project\r\n\r\n   <https://witnessstonesproject.org/upcoming-events/?utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope you will be able to take this opportunity to learn about our\r\ncollective heritage and to understand the continuing importance of\r\nJuneteenth as we work toward a more just and equitable society.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRodmon King\r\nDean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion\r\n\r\nReginald White\r\nVice President for Human Resources and Organizational Management\r\n\r\nOffice of the President 860-439-2666 <8604392666>\r\n270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320\r\n<https://maps.google.com/?q=270+Mohegan+Avenue%C2%A0%C2%A0+%7C+%C2%A0%C2%A0New+London,+CT+06320&utm_source=%2AMaster+List-THIS+IS+EVERYONE&utm_campaign=10f6268955-solidarity_support_053020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a01830749c-10f6268955->\r\n\r\nView this email in your browser\r\n<https://us4.campaign-archive.com/?e=__test_email__&u=3a272439f0dc93573b210a24d&id=10f6268955>\r\n  |   Update your preferences\r\n<https://conncoll.us4.list-manage.com/profile?u=3a272439f0dc93573b210a24d&id=a01830749c&e=__test_email__&c=10f6268955>\r\n  |   Unsubscribe\r\n<https://conncoll.us4.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=3a272439f0dc93573b210a24d&id=a01830749c&e=__test_email__&c=10f6268955>\r\n\r\n"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] From the President: Off-campus Housing"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nThese are unprecedented times for Conn. Our record number of deposits from\r\nadmitted students now stands at 660, making the Class of 2026 by far the\r\nlargest in the College\u2019s history. While this is a welcome sign of Conn\u2019s\r\ngrowing reputation for excellence, it also creates housing, curricular,\r\nadvising and other challenges that we are actively working to address. This\r\nletter is about housing.\r\n\r\nON CAMPUS VS OFF CAMPUS\r\nOur first order of business, of course, is to make as many residential\r\nspaces available on campus as possible, and we have already engaged an\r\narchitect to work on simple steps we can take this summer to increase our\r\ninventory of rooms. Still, on-campus inventory will not be enough to house\r\nthe total number of students we expect to enroll in the fall, so we have\r\nalso been pursuing off-campus strategies for upperclass students.\r\n\r\nAs you know, for the past two years we have allowed students to live off\r\ncampus for two main reasons:  to create COVID-19 isolation beds and to\r\noffset higher on-campus enrollment caused by fewer students studying\r\nabroad. Unlike many other residential colleges, Conn doesn't have many\r\nrental properties in the immediate vicinity, so students opting to live\r\noff-campus have been scattered across New London County\u2014and therefore more\r\ndisconnected from the residential experience than we or they would like.\r\n\r\nFortunately, a new option has recently come to light that will allow\r\nstudents to live together, increase the number of apartment-style units\r\nthat we offer and enhance Conn\u2019s connection with downtown New London.\r\n\r\nTHE MANWARING BUILDING\r\nSoon after learning of our record deposits on May 2, Victor Arcelus and\r\nRich Madonna reached out to Max Patinkin and Dash Davidson, two developers\r\nthey met last year. Their company\u2014High Tide Capital\u2014works with communities\r\nto restore historic buildings for residential and commercial use. In\r\ncoordination with the City of New London, they are currently renovating\r\nhistoric buildings on both State Street and Bank Street.\r\n\r\nTheir renovation of one property\u2014the Manwaring Building on State Street\u2014is\r\non track to be completed by the end of the summer,  just in time for the\r\nreturn of our students in August. The building is next to City Hall and\r\nwithin a few blocks of the Garde Arts Center, the City\u2019s waterfront and a\r\nnumber of other amenities. Over the past two weeks, the College\u2019s senior\r\nadministrative team has assessed the feasibility of housing approximately\r\n60 upperclass students in this historic property.  This assessment has\r\nincluded outreach to city officials and other community stakeholders to\r\nbetter understand the implications of this arrangement for the residents of\r\nNew London.\r\n\r\nThe building itself will encompass 21 one- and two-bedroom units, which\r\ncould be used to house students as follows: one-bedroom/one-bathroom\r\napartments accommodating two students, two-bedroom/two-bathroom apartments\r\nsuitable for four students and two-bedroom/two-bathroom two-story townhomes\r\nfor four students. Each unit comes with a kitchen, living area, and washer\r\nand dryer. In addition, the Manwaring Building has a common area that could\r\nbe used as a student study or gathering space, as well as access to a\r\nparking garage via a pedestrian bridge connected to the second floor of the\r\nbuilding. The building can accommodate a Conn staff member living on the\r\npremises along with two Residential Education and Living student leaders.\r\nFinally, the building has a street-level storefront space that the College\r\ncan activate as we see fit.\r\n\r\nSEAT  offers two types of transportation\r\noptions from the College to downtown New London\u2013fixed route bus service and\r\nSmart-Ride bus service. The College, SEAT and New London city officials are\r\ndiscussing how students can use the public transportation system with the\r\ncost covered by the College. Further information will be available this\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nSHARED GOVERNANCE\r\nLast week, Conn\u2019s senior administrative team discussed the plan with\r\nfaculty, students and staff on major governance committees \u2013 FSCC, PPBC,\r\nFLMC, SGA \u2013 as well as with faculty and staff in the Holleran Center for\r\nCommunity Action. The campus conversation and feedback have been helpful\r\nand quite positive, even enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nWe took that feedback to the Board of Trustees on Friday as they met to\r\nreview the proposed partnership. The overwhelming consensus from the Board\r\nwas that this arrangement will help the College meet immediate student\r\nhousing needs; offer a new dimension to student life; provide expanded\r\nopportunities for community engagement and academic programming downtown;\r\nstrengthen our relationship with our host city; and contribute to the\r\neconomic revitalization of New London\u2019s historic center.\r\n\r\nThe Board authorized the administration to finalize the plan for housing\r\nstudents in the Manwaring Building beginning in fall 2022. The Office of\r\nResidential Education and Living will send information to the student body\r\nearly this week about how students can participate in the housing selection\r\nprocess to live in the Manwaring Building.\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting opportunity for students, the College and the city. It\r\nis exactly the kind of apartment-style housing we have wanted to make\r\navailable to those seeking more independent residential experiences. As the\r\nsummer unfolds, we will continue to engage campus and community\r\nstakeholders to prepare for this new housing option and we will update you\r\non progress.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] A Message from the President: next Dean of the Faculty"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nI am delighted to announce that Danielle Egan will be the next Dean of the\r\nFaculty at Connecticut College, effective July 1, 2022.\r\n\r\nDanielle joined Connecticut College in 2017 as the Fuller-Matthai Professor\r\nand Chair of Gender, Sexuality, and Intersectionality Studies.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] News From the April 2022 Board of Trustees Meeting"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trustees gathered for its spring meeting on April 29 and 30,\r\nconvening earlier than usual to mark two important milestones: the campus\r\nlaunch of the Defy Boundaries campaign and the public reopening and\r\nrededication of Palmer Auditorium as the Nancy and Preston Athey Center for\r\nPerformance and Research.  I am writing to report on the meeting and\r\naccompanying events.\r\n\r\n*The Athey Center*\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Athey Center was made possible by the generosity of\r\nseveral individuals and foundations, beginning with two transformative\r\ngifts in 2018\u2014one from Bonnie Himmelman \u201966 of the Sherman Fairchild\r\nFoundation and the other from Nancy \u201972 and Preston Athey. The meticulous\r\nrestoration of Palmer includes a modernized hall with restored natural\r\nlight, spacious seating, state-of-the-art lighting and sound, and a\r\nresilient floor for dance. The building offers a new home for the Theater\r\nDepartment and the office of Arts Programming; new areas for collaboration\r\nand teaching; a refurbished costume shop; video displays; a new marquis;\r\nenergy-efficient lighting, heating, and cooling; an elevator making the\r\nbuilding fully accessible for the first time; and a redesigned garden on\r\nTempel Green. The day-long program included a ribbon cutting; tours; a\r\ncommunity lunch; a signing of the Covenant of Shared Governance; a formal\r\nrededication ceremony; and an evening of music, theater, and dance\r\nshowcasing student and alumni talent.\r\n\r\n*Asset reinvestment*\r\n\r\nAs the first major capital project of the Defy Boundaries campaign, the\r\nPalmer renewal is also the first full-scale renovation the building has\r\nseen since its opening in 1939. In that respect, it represents a\r\nsignificant reinvestment in our campus infrastructure, and Friday\u2019s plenary\r\nsession offered an opportunity for the Board to engage the topic of\r\nrebuilding our physical endowment. The Vice President for Finance and\r\nAdministration Rich Madonna, the Dean of Strategic and Global Initiatives\r\nAmy Dooling, and the Dean of Students Victor Arcelus led a discussion on\r\nthe importance of capital renewal for academic research and innovation,\r\nstudent recruitment and retention, and for the College\u2019s sustainability,\r\nincluding the recently announced goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.\r\n\r\nThe Board reviewed the timeline for accelerated capital improvement over\r\nthe next several years. Projects planned for summer 2022 include focused\r\nwork in residence halls; upgrades to 24 classrooms and two departmental\r\nbuildings; the creation of the new Stark Center for the Moving Image; the\r\nrepurposing of Gallows Lane to support field research; the rebuilding of\r\nthe Thames River waterfront to support marine science as well as rowing,\r\nsailing, and outdoor recreation; enhancements to Dayton Arena; and several\r\ncampus energy improvements. Projects anticipated for summer 2023 include\r\ncritical dining and residence hall renovations as well as landscape\r\ninterventions to make a greener and more pedestrian friendly campus. Beyond\r\nPalmer, the Board took note of the other major capital projects of the Defy\r\nBoundaries campaign, including the renovation of the College Center at\r\nCrozier Williams, a planned addition to the Athletic Center, and the\r\nrestoration of Bill Hall.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, trustees heard from Miles Sax, Charles and Sarah P.\r\nBecker \u201927 Director of the Connecticut College Arboretum, about investments\r\nthat have expanded the capacity of this unique asset for teaching and\r\nresearch\u2014an action called for in our strategic plan. Connecticut College is\r\nthe only college among our NESCAC peers and one of just a small group of\r\nschools in the U.S. with an accredited arboretum.\r\n\r\n*Financial Sustainability*\r\n\r\nDiscussion of capital investments connected to the larger theme of\r\nfinancial sustainability, a strategic priority and a continuous focus of\r\nour work. The Finance Committee recommended and the full Board approved a\r\ncash-operating budget for FY23 of $105.7 million, which includes a 3%\r\nincrease in tuition and fees for AY 2022-23 as well as an increase in\r\nfinancial aid, a 2% increase to the faculty and staff salary pool, and a\r\npartial restoration of the 403b retirement contribution to 7.5%. These\r\nbudget decisions were taken with the understanding that, in light of\r\ncontinuing economic uncertainty, the College must be more disciplined in\r\naddressing the challenges of our tuition-driven, high-touch residential\r\nmodel. And that will require producing not just budgets that balance every\r\nyear but also a financial plan that works over the long term. The Executive\r\nCommittee and the Finance Committee will work with senior administration\r\nand faculty leaders in the coming months to bring a discussion of both the\r\nFY 24 budget and the long-term plan to the full Board for discussion in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nEnrollment is, of course, a key driver of financial strength. This year,\r\nwith the Board meeting before May 1, the discussion of enrollment for the\r\nClass of 2026 was limited to what we could know as of April 29\u2014and, at that\r\npoint, the news already pointed to record commitments. By May 1, the number\r\nhad climbed beyond 650, by far the highest in College history. Members of\r\nthe senior administration, faculty, and staff are now working on\r\ncurricular, advising, and housing needs for this bountiful class. The\r\nfinancial planning for FY 24 will also have to figure in the larger class,\r\nwhich will stay with us for the next four years.\r\n\r\n*Faculty and Student Affairs*\r\n\r\nFinances were a central theme in other committee discussions. The Committee\r\non Academic Affairs discussed the outcomes of recent faculty recruitment;\r\nplans for increased support and mentoring of pre-tenure faculty; next\r\nyear\u2019s staffing plan; as well as compensation. Board members were advised\r\non the reissuing of appointment letters for tenure-track and continuing\r\nfaculty, in cases where the initial offers had included inappropriate\r\nterms. They also discussed the importance of maintaining competitive\r\nfaculty and staff salaries for recruitment and retention.\r\n\r\nRetention of students was another theme. The Committee on Student\r\nExperience discussed ongoing initiatives focused on both first-to-second\r\nyear retention and student persistence. Related to this are data now being\r\nanalyzed from the HEDs Diversity and Equity campus climate survey, on which\r\nthe Dean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion Rodmon King gave a\r\npreliminary report. Dean of the College Erika Smith also led a conversation\r\nwith Persephone Hall about the transformation of career services since the\r\nrelocation of the Hale Center to Fanning Hall in 2019. Of particular note\r\nare the strong enrollments in the new career foundation course; the value\r\nof the flexible career action funding; and the expanded networking emerging\r\nfrom stronger collaboration with the Office of Alumni Relations.\r\n\r\n*Fundraising and Endowment*\r\n\r\nThe Committees on Advancement and Marketing and Communications considered\r\nthe progress of the Defy Boundaries campaign in its fifth year. With new\r\ngifts and commitments for this year reaching $35 million as of April 30,\r\nthe campaign total is projected to exceed $220 million by June 30, or 75%\r\ntoward the $300 million goal.  Also noted was the robust participation of\r\nstudents in the Camels Count giving challenge this year, up 150% from 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the endowment, the Board voted to support the incorporation of\r\nenvironmental, social, and governance  factors into the College\u2019s\r\ninvestment strategies to reduce risk and improve the long-term returns of\r\nthe portfolio; as well as to increase diversity and equity in its portfolio\r\nthrough more inclusive investment practices. The revised investment policy\r\nstatement will take effect July 1, 2022.\r\n\r\n*Appointments, Promotions, and Departures*\r\n\r\nAccording to custom, trustees reviewed appointments of new faculty and\r\napproved recent promotions. Fourteen faculty will join the College in the\r\nfall in the departments of Botany, Computer Science, Economics, Education,\r\nEnglish, Film, French, Government, History, Human Development, Music, and\r\nPsychology. The Board approved one promotion to full professor;  two to\r\nfull professor continuing part-time; five to associate professor with\r\ntenure; one promotion to associate professor continuing part-time; and one\r\nto senior lecturer, all effective July 1, 2022.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] A Message from the President"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Students,\r\n\r\nThe past 10 days have been an exciting time. Our final Camel Day for\r\nadmitted students took place a week ago Monday and the Board of Trustees\r\ncame to the College for their spring meetings three days after that. I will\r\nbe sending a longer letter about the Board meetings shortly. For now, I\r\nwanted to report on one important outcome of the weekend: the Class of\r\n2026.\r\n\r\nAs you know, May 1 was the deadline for admitted students from next year\u2019s\r\nclass to inform us of their decision to enroll. I am happy to report that,\r\nin a year when we saw the largest application volume in our history, we\r\nalso saw record deposits. By May 1, a total of 651 students had indicated\r\ntheir intention to enroll at Conn, a number that far exceeds our\r\nexpectation. We knew predictions would be difficult given the uncertainty\r\nof the past two years, but this result defies all odds.\r\n\r\nLike you, this new Class of 2026 is an academically talented, diverse, and\r\nsocially engaged group. And, like you, they felt drawn to this community\u2014in\r\nlarge numbers.\r\n\r\nWe can read this as a sign that Conn\u2019s reputation for academic excellence\r\nremains strong. It is a sign that our investments in Connections, career,\r\nglobal education, and full participation are making a difference. And from\r\nwhat I observed, I would also say it is a sign that your presence\r\nhere\u2014especially during our most recent Camel Day events\u2014was particularly\r\nmeaningful for this class. I want to thank you for your warm welcome, just\r\nas I thank all our student and professional staff in admissions for their\r\nexceptional work.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we will do what we always do between May 1 and September 1:\r\nmonitor the class to determine exactly how many students we can expect come\r\nfall. Because we believe that number will be higher than normal, we are now\r\nworking through the curricular, housing, and programmatic requirements to\r\nsupport a larger class, as well as the financial implications.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the deans are working with individual departments and faculty to\r\naddress expected course needs. And we will be adding to some of our\r\nanticipated summer projects to increase classroom and housing capacity. You\r\nwill be hearing more about these things in due course.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, we look forward with excitement to August when we will\r\nwelcome, with you, our newest Camels to this exceptional community.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

He will begin his new\r\nrole on May 2.\r\n\r\nJohn is a dynamic leader who brings to Conn more than three decades of\r\nexperience as a journalist, writer, and spokesperson for higher education.\r\nHe earned a B.A. in English Literature from Denison University and an M.S.\r\nin Journalism from Ohio University. He then built a career in journalism,\r\nwhere his award-winning coverage of the environment, urban affairs, social\r\njustice, and other critical issues appeared in *The Washington Post*, *Los\r\nAngeles Times*, *Roanoke Times*, and other venues. His work as a foreign\r\ncorrespondent included coverage of military and civilian conflicts in\r\nEurope, Latin America, Asia and the former Soviet Union. He later shifted\r\nhis effort to higher education, holding leadership roles at Princeton\r\nUniversity, Dartmouth College, Johns Hopkins Medicine and Vermont Law\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nAs a leader, John has demonstrated a commitment to collaborative policies\r\nand practices that result in effective decision-making and outcomes. His\r\ncareer in higher education has been focused on both telling compelling\r\nstories and developing strategies that will shine a spotlight on the\r\nresearch, teaching, and service being done by exceptional faculty, staff,\r\nand students. As the new Vice President for Marketing and Communications at\r\nConnecticut College, he will be responsible for leading our talented\r\nmarketing and communications team, leveraging the College\u2019s history of\r\nacademic excellence, crafting a compelling narrative of educational\r\nexcellence and impact, and developing new approaches to elevate our\r\nnational reputation as a higher education leader.\r\n\r\nJohn comes into this role at a critical moment for higher education, as\r\ninstitutions navigate increasing financial, demographic, and cultural\r\nchallenges in a post-pandemic future. He arrives at a critical moment for\r\nConn, as well, as we look to achieve the ambitious goals of the Defy\r\nBoundaries campaign. Our continued success as a college will depend on our\r\nability to enhance our reputation for academic excellence, our distinctive\r\neducational philosophy, and the value of our unique campus community.\r\nJohn\u2019s leadership skills and range of experience, combined with his\r\ncreative and collaborative energy, make him the ideal person to lead this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone who participated in the process, especially Rich\r\nMadonna, Vice President for Finance and Administration, who chaired the\r\nsearch, and all the committee members whose collegial good judgment led to\r\nthis outcome: Andrea Wollensak, Professor of Art; Alyss Humphrey, Class of\r\n\u201922; Andy Strickler, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid; Debo Adegbile\r\n\u201991, chair of the Connecticut College Board of Trustees; and trustees Eric\r\nKaplan \u201985 and Pamela Zilly \u201975, who currently lead the Board\u2019s committees\r\non marketing and communications and advancement.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] News From the Feb. 2022 Board of Trustees Meeting"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trustees met online for their winter meeting on Feb. 11 and\r\n12. I am writing to report on the discussions that took place.\r\n\r\nThe Board\u2019s plenary sessions were focused on two different but equally\r\nimportant topics: one looking inward, at student mental health and the\r\ndevelopment of mental health support at Connecticut College; the other\r\nlooking outward, following the College\u2019s historic national championship\r\nvictory in December, at the work being done to elevate competitive success\r\nin athletics.\r\n\r\nStudent mental health is an area of critical concern for the College, and a\r\ntopic that the Board has taken up in the past. Given the circumstances of\r\nthe past two years, the Board wanted to have a deeper conversation about\r\npandemic-related shifts in student wellbeing. Victor Arcelus, dean of\r\nstudents, along with Sarah Cardwell, senior associate dean, and Bryana\r\nWhite, assistant director of student counseling services, led a discussion\r\non the state of student mental health across the country and the tiered\r\napproach Connecticut College is taking to address rising demand on our own\r\ncampus. The presentation covered broad-based educational outreach efforts,\r\nnon-clinical interventions, as well as clinical services offered both\r\nin-person and online. Of particular interest were some recent innovations\r\nat Conn: the workshops for faculty and staff on helping students build\r\ndistress tolerance; and the new student support positions now built into\r\nthe department of campus safety to enhance expertise in responding to\r\nlate-night crises.\r\n\r\nThe second plenary discussion took up the progress on the College\u2019s action\r\nplan for competitive success, based on the strategic goals of strengthening\r\nthe student experience and elevating the College\u2019s visibility and\r\nreputation. The presentation addressed the longstanding scholar-athlete\r\nideal and the development of Conn\u2019s athletic programs over the past 50\r\nyears, to frame the more recent work to achieve excellence in recruitment,\r\ncoaching, and the student athlete experience. Victor Arcelus again led the\r\ndiscussion with Mo White, director of athletics, and our now decorated head\r\ncoach of men\u2019s soccer Reuben Burk, along with Lorenzo Bocchetti, one of the\r\nco-captains of the men\u2019s soccer team. The committee on Marketing and\r\nCommunications extended this conversation with data on the surge in social\r\nmedia visibility following the national championship.\r\n\r\nOther committee discussions focused on the College\u2019s ongoing COVID\r\nresponse, enrollment and retention, FY 22 and 23 budget scenarios,\r\ninvestments, facilities, fundraising, and academic innovations.\r\n\r\n*Enrollment, Finances, and Investments*\r\nThe Committee on the Student Experience discussed the effects of the\r\npandemic on student wellbeing and persistence. Erika Smith, dean of the\r\ncollege, gave a presentation on first-to-second-year retention, noting the\r\ndrop from fall 2020 to fall 2021, caused in part by an increase in student\r\npersonal and medical leaves. She also outlined both short- and long-term\r\nintervention plans that are underway.\r\n\r\nStudent enrollment was also a topic in the Finance Committee, which looked\r\nat the favorable FY 22 budget projections along with the budget parameters\r\nfor FY23. Andy Strickler discussed some initial data from the nearly 9,000\r\napplications we received for the Class of 2026, which show an increase in\r\nboth academic quality and potential affinity for Connecticut College. The\r\nbudget parameters for FY 23 include provisions for increases in\r\ncompensation and in the College\u2019s contribution to the 401K. The committee\r\nhas plans to hold additional mid-cycle meetings to discuss longer-range\r\nbudget planning before the final approval of the FY 23 budget in May.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance  investing was taken up by the\r\nInvestment Committee. Margaret Bounds and Doug Thompson were invited to a\r\ndiscussion with committee members about ESG criteria and their use in\r\nevaluating the soundness of investments and in avoiding future financial\r\nrisk. As of December 2021, the College\u2019s endowment had reached $453.2\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n*Academic Innovations*\r\nThe Committee on Academic Affairs had a first discussion of the staffing\r\nplan for 2022-23, and then did a deeper dive in the College\u2019s efforts to\r\ncreate more Open Educational Resources for students. Members of the\r\nlibrary\u2019s instructional technology team as well as faculty who have created\r\ntheir own free textbooks came together to talk about the importance of\r\nthese efforts for the College\u2019s goal of full participation.\r\n\r\n*Facilities and Fundraising*\r\nEnterprise systems and the advantages of moving to a cloud environment was\r\none of the areas discussed by the Facilities and Infrastructure Committee.\r\nThe other area of focus was the College\u2019s capital budget and the list of\r\ninfrastructure projects being planned as a result of the Hale gift, other\r\nphilanthropic support, and a recent Board-approved debt issuance. Projects\r\nplanned for summer 2022 include classroom renovations; improvements to\r\nresidence halls, admissions, athletic facilities, and the waterfront; and\r\nenergy upgrades related to our sustainability plan. The committee also\r\nreviewed progress on the nearly complete Athey Center for Performance and\r\nResearch, which will have its official rededication on April 29.\r\n\r\nThe Advancement Committee focused on results of the Defy Boundaries\r\ncampaign since its public launch in October. Current campaign gifts and\r\npledges stand at $220 million, or 73% towards the College\u2019s goal of $300\r\nmillion. The Committee also discussed alumni participation rates and new\r\nmethods to expand both the volunteer and the donor pool in the final years\r\nof the campaign.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board had the opportunity to welcome Rodmon King as our new\r\ndean of institutional equity and inclusion as well as Reginald White, our\r\nnew vice president of Human Resources, who will begin on March 14. The next\r\nBoard meeting is anticipated to be in person, on April 29, to coincide with\r\nthe rededication of Palmer Auditorium and the campus celebration of the\r\nDefy Boundaries campaign.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] A Message from the President"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nI am pleased to announce that Deborah Bial, founder and president of The\r\nPosse Foundation, will deliver the keynote address at our 104th\r\nCommencement on Sunday, May 22, 2022.\r\n\r\nBial, winner of a 2007 MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Fellowship, is a leader in the\r\nfield of college access, persistence, and student success. Her experience\r\nin advancing equity, diversity, and talent at selective colleges and\r\nuniversities\u2014and in creating solutions towards more equitable\r\nadmissions\u2014has gained her national prominence in higher education\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nBial received her bachelor of arts in American and English Literature from\r\nBrandeis University in 1987. Two years later, she started a new\r\norganization she would call \u201cPosse,\u201d after hearing a student lament that he\r\nwould never have left college if he had found his posse. Her idea was to\r\npartner with selective colleges and help them bring teams, or posses, of\r\ntalented student leaders from the same city to pursue higher education on\r\ntheir campuses. That simple idea would turn into one of the most successful\r\ncollege leadership programs in the country. Since 1989, The Posse\r\nFoundation has sent over 10,000 students to 60 partner colleges,\r\ninstitutions that have collectively provided more than $1.6 billion in\r\nmerit scholarships. In 2010, President Obama named Posse as one of 10\r\nnonprofits that would share his Nobel Prize.\r\n\r\nBy then, Bial had gone on to receive both masters and doctoral degrees from\r\nthe Harvard Graduate School of Education. Today, she is a member of the\r\nBrandeis Board of Trustees, where she chairs the Diversity, Equity and\r\nInclusion committee. She also sits on the Board of Directors at Xometry,\r\nInc.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Commencement ceremony, the College will award Bial a doctor\r\nof humane letters *honoris causa*, a degree that reflects her lifelong\r\ncommitment to fostering campus environments where students thrive, reach\r\ntheir potential, and contribute to others\u2019 flourishing\u2014what we like to\r\ncall *full\r\nparticipation*.\r\n\r\nBial\u2019s presence will be especially meaningful in a year when Connecticut\r\nCollege has welcomed a talented Posse alumna, Erika J. Smith, as our new\r\ndean of the College. Among our own notable Posse alumni leaders are Chakena\r\nSims Perry \u201916, winner of Posse\u2019s 2020 Ainsley Alumni Achievement Award;\r\nMaurice Tiner \u201917, Director of Race and Ethnicity Programs at Connecticut\r\nCollege; and Christian Vasquez \u201919, one of the inaugural Ubben fellows who\r\nnow works directly with Bial in the Posse Foundation offices.\r\n\r\n\r\nConnecticut College\u2019s partnership with Posse began in 2008\u2014when we selected\r\nour very first group of students from Chicago\u2014and expanded in 2020 with the\r\nintroduction of a second Posse from New York City. By May, a total of 95\r\nscholars will have graduated from the College since 2012. This is a\r\nmilestone we can celebrate together as we honor Deborah Bial.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to the Commencement Speaker Committee for their thoughtful\r\ndeliberation: co-chairs Lauren Middleton and Ava Ernst \u201922; students Piper\r\nBurke \u201922, Elizabeth Lopez \u201922, and Long Ta \u201922; and faculty and staff\r\nmembers Anne Bernhard, Luci Chaplin, Marc Forster, Ayako Takamori, and\r\nTiffany Thiele.\r\n\r\nIt will be a pleasure to welcome Deborah Bial to Connecticut College for\r\nour 104th Commencement.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Reginald White Named New Vice President for Human Resources"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nI am delighted to announce that Reginald White, currently the Senior\r\nDirector of Human Resources for the division of research and innovation at\r\nCornell University, will become the next Vice President for Human Resources\r\nat Connecticut College. He will begin in his new role on March 14.\r\n\r\nReginald is a talented leader who brings to Conn three decades of\r\nprofessional experience in human resources, marketing, and finance together\r\nwith a deep commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. He earned a\r\nB.S. in Psychology and Human Development from Cornell and an Executive\r\nM.B.A. from Boston University, and went on to hold positions at Bank of\r\nBoston, Citibank, and Key Bank, before moving into executive leadership\r\nroles in human resources and marketing at both Fidelity Investments and\r\nMerrill Lynch. In 2009, he founded Toran Enterprises, a consulting firm\r\nspecializing in executive coaching and professional development in equity\r\nand inclusion for both international and domestic clients. In 2017, he\r\nreturned to his alma mater as an organizational strategist and, in 2019,\r\nbecame senior director of human resources for Cornell\u2019s research division.\r\n\r\nMuch of Reginald\u2019s career has been focused on developing strategies to\r\ncreate more equitable communities. As a leader, he has been committed to\r\nadvancing policies and practices that allow all members of a community to\r\nachieve their potential and feel a sense of place and of belonging. For the\r\npast three years, that commitment has been focused in the division of\r\nresearch and innovation at Cornell, where he has been a strategic partner\r\nto the Vice President and has overseen human resources and communications\r\nfor the division\u2019s many centers and programs. In that capacity, Reginald\r\nhas also provided opportunities for equity and leadership development to\r\nstaff and faculty across the campus. In 2020, he became an employee-elected\r\nrepresentative to the Cornell Board of Trustees. We are thrilled that he\r\nwill be bringing his broad vision of full participation to human resources\r\nat Connecticut College.\r\n\r\nAs the new Vice President for Human Resources, Reginald will be responsible\r\nfor the care and development of a talented workforce with over 700\r\nemployees in a range of professional roles. This includes fostering\r\ninnovation in every dimension of the job: from organizational design to\r\nrecruitment and hiring; from employee relations to job assessment and\r\nsatisfaction; from health and benefits administration to document\r\nmanagement; from personnel classification and compensation to continuous\r\nprofessional development. He comes into the role at a moment when employers\r\nacross the country are redoubling their efforts to advance diversity,\r\nequity, and inclusion; reassess workplace practices; and improve employee\r\nexperience in an increasingly competitive market for talent\u2014all while\r\ndealing with an ongoing pandemic. Reginald\u2019s range of experience, combined\r\nwith his creative and collaborative spirit, make him the ideal leader to\r\nbuild a new kind of HR office\u2014one that not only elevates the experience of\r\nall who work at Conn but also becomes an exemplar for the future of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone who participated in the search process, especially\r\nLee Hisle, Vice President for Information Services, who chaired the search,\r\nand all the committee members whose collegial good judgment led to this\r\noutcome: Jeffrey Cole, Dean of the Faculty; Luci Chaplin, Senior Associate\r\nDirector of Alumni and Parent Giving in the Office of Advancement and a\r\nmember of Staff Council; Persephone Hall, Executive Director of the Hale\r\nCenter for Career Development; Anne Kelley, Assistant Director of Budget\r\nand Administration in the Office of Facilities Management; Larry Lewellen,\r\nInterim Vice President for Human Resources; and Leslie Wong, President\r\nEmeritus of San Francisco State University and member of the Connecticut\r\nCollege Board of Trustees.\r\n\r\nThere will be occasions in the coming weeks for you to meet Reginald in\r\nperson.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] The Passing of Charles Barton Luce Sr."], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nIt is with sadness that I write to inform you that Charles Barton Luce Sr.,\r\nprofessor emeritus of physical education at Connecticut College, passed\r\naway at his home on January 5th. It was one day after his 93rd birthday.\r\n\r\nCharles\u2014or Charlie, as everyone called him\u2014was a treasure. An accomplished\r\ncoach and administrator, he led men\u2019s basketball and served as director of\r\nathletics at the College for 18 critical years between 1974-92. During this\r\ntime he not only elevated athletics but he also, quite literally, built the\r\nfoundation on which our program rests today.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1929 in Peoria, Ill., Charlie attended Boston University, where he\r\nmajored in physical education and played Division I basketball. After\r\ngraduating, he coached high school in New York and Connecticut, including\r\neight years at Greenwich High, before returning to BU in 1967 to become\r\nhead men\u2019s basketball coach and later assistant director of athletics.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, he came to Conn to direct physical education, coach basketball,\r\nand, most importantly, develop a new varsity athletics program. It was just\r\nfive years after the College had embraced co-education, and there was much\r\nto do. And so he set out to create a whole new set of competitive athletic\r\nofferings for both women and men. He more than doubled the number of\r\nsports, adding men\u2019s ice hockey, men\u2019s lacrosse, women\u2019s soccer, men\u2019s and\r\nwomen\u2019s crew, and ultimately redefined the meaning of athletic engagement,\r\nwith as many as 75 percent of the student body participating at one point\r\nin varsity, club, and intramural sports. Through his persistence and zeal,\r\nhe created a modern department of athletics aligned with the College\u2019s\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nThe growing program required new facilities and Charlie was, once again,\r\ninstrumental in shaping the vision. He helped oversee the planning and\r\nconstruction of Dayton Arena in 1979, Dawley Field in 1986, and what would\r\nlater become the Lyn and David Silfen Track and Field in 1996. On his\r\nretirement in 1992, the main department building was renamed The Charles B.\r\nLuce Field House in his honor.\r\n\r\nBeyond these notable\u2014and visible\u2014achievements, perhaps the greatest legacy\r\nhe left was his orchestration of Connecticut College\u2019s entry into the New\r\nEngland Small College Athletics Conference . This was in 1982.\r\nUnder then-President Oakes Ames, Luce took the steps that allowed the\r\nCollege to join what would soon be known as the most elite Division III\r\nconference in the country. We are thrilled that Charlie lived to see the\r\nday that his beloved Camels not only prevailed in the NESCAC but also won\r\nnational recognition with their first ever NCAA championship.\r\n\r\nLuce stepped down as athletic director in 1992 but remained with the\r\nCollege as an advancement officer for two more years. In 1996, he was\r\ninducted into the Connecticut College Athletic Hall of Fame, and, in 2000,\r\nreceived the College Medal in recognition of two decades of transformative\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nWith his institutional vision and deep compassion, Charles Luce left his\r\nmark on generations of Connecticut College students. It is fitting, then,\r\nthat he would also create the College\u2019s very first award for a\r\nscholar-athlete, the Brown-Brooks Award, named after its first recipients,\r\nJames Brooks \u201984 and Tammy Brown \u201984. The award recognizes those students\r\nwho reflect the highest ideals of citizenship and success on the field and\r\nbeyond\u2014values that were central to Luce\u2019s own character. In Tammy\u2019s words,\r\n\u201cCharlie had such a gentle and caring spirit and a way of bringing out the\r\nbest in you. You left his presence feeling uplifted. He will always be a\r\npart of my wonderful Conn College memories.\u201d\r\n\r\nDebo P. Adegbile \u201991, chair of the Board of Trustees, said of Luce: \u201cHe was\r\nnot only an architect of the athletics program at our College, but also an\r\nembodiment of the way in which we value, in equal measure, dedication and\r\nexcellence in competition and character and personal growth. Charlie knew\r\nthat our athletics program was a training ground for personal and\r\nprofessional success in life, and, at Conn College, he experienced both.\u201d\r\n\r\nA memorial gathering is being planned for Sunday, June 5, during Reunion\r\nWeekend, to allow alumni, students, faculty, staff, and friends the\r\nopportunity to celebrate Charlie\u2019s life. Information about that event will\r\nbe shared as soon as it is available. In lieu of flowers, the family asks\r\nthat gifts in his memory be made to the Leukemia-Lymphoma Society\r\n<http://givenow.lls.org> or to Connecticut College\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/giving/>, directed toward student financial aid.\r\n\r\nThe patriarch of a true multi-generational Camel family, Charles was\r\npredeceased by his first wife, Gay Devine Luce, mother of his four sons:\r\nChuck P\u201997; Mike; Tim \u201979, P\u201911; and Bill \u201981 P \u201914. I ask you to join me\r\nin extending our deepest condolences to his sons; his wife, Margery; his\r\nsister Claire; his stepson Bill and stepdaughter Heather; his 12\r\ngrandchildren, including fellow Camels Emily \u201997, Erin \u201911, and Nick \u201914;\r\nand his three great-grandchildren.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] Elevating the Legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr."], "completion": " cl\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,  Today, the College is\r\nclosed in observance of the national holiday commemorating the Rev. Dr.\r\nMartin Luther King, Jr. It is a holiday that emerged from our nation\u2019s\r\nbelated understanding of all that Dr. King stood for: a vision of a just\r\nworld free of poverty and oppression and a commitment to non-violence, even\r\nin the face of brutality. At the same time, the day reminds us that the\r\nwork Dr. King began more than a half-century ago remains woefully\r\nunfinished. This point was recently emphasized by the King family when they\r\nasked that any celebration this year be linked to advocacy for legislation\r\nthat will protect our most sacred and democratic right: the right to vote. Dr.\r\nKing\u2019s family will be leading a march for voting rights today in our\r\nnation\u2019s capital. That act encourages us to think about the role we, too,\r\nshould be playing. Almost 40 percent of states this past year passed more\r\nrestrictive voting laws, largely in reaction to  baseless claims that the\r\nresults of the 2020 presidential election were fraudulent, claims that\r\nultimately led to the January 2021 attack on the Capitol. On the one-year\r\nanniversary of that violence, we can hardly afford to take this precious\r\nright for granted. Our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and trustees have\r\nshown us the way. Debo Adegbile \u201991, Chair of the Board of Trustees, twice\r\ndefended the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965\u2014one of Dr.\r\nKing\u2019s signature legislative victories\u2014before the United States Supreme\r\nCourt. Chakena Sims Perry \u201916 was honored by the Posse Foundation in 2020\r\nfor her work as president of Chicago Votes, a non-profit focused on\r\ncreating a more inclusive democracy. Prof. Mara Suttman-Lea received a\r\nprestigious award from the Social Science Research Council to support her\r\nresearch on voter education and participation. And Connecticut College,\r\njoining 160 other colleges and universities in the ALL IN Campus Democracy\r\nChallenge, saw voter participation in the 2020 presidential election rise\r\nto nearly 80%. We are grateful to the student, staff, and faculty leaders\r\nof Camels Vote <https://www.camelsvote.org>\u2014Conn\u2019s nonpartisan initiative\r\nsupported by the Holleran Center\u2014who made this outcome possible. And we\r\nstand today with the King family in their efforts to strengthen the\r\nfoundational principles of our democracy. This week, we will have another\r\nopportunity to reflect on those principles during Elevate\r\n<http://elevate.conncoll.edu>, the second annual conference on social\r\njustice at Connecticut College. This year\u2019s conference, which takes place\r\nvirtually on Jan. 19 and 20, takes up the complex issue of housing justice,\r\na key tenet of Dr. King\u2019s work, which posthumously inspired the Fair\r\nHousing Act. Keynote speakers include Rosemary Ndubuizu on housing justice\r\nand reproductive justice; Christopher Coleman on disability rights; Lanitra\r\nBerger on social justice in our lives and work; and Jenee Osterheldt on\r\nBlack joy as a beautiful form of resistance. A series of workshops will be\r\nled by staff members in the division of institutional equity and inclusion\r\nJustin Mendillo \u201918, Rachel Stewart, and Maurice Tiner \u201917. And Rodmon\r\nKing, our incoming dean, will be featured in conversation with Prof. Ari\r\nRotramel, whose fine work as interim dean will come to an end later this\r\nmonth. A full schedule <http://elevate.conncoll.edu/schedule/> for Elevate\r\nis online, and registration for each virtual session is now open. We hope\r\nyou will take advantage of this timely opportunity not only to commemorate\r\nthe life and legacy of Dr. King but also to elevate that legacy by becoming\r\nactively engaged as citizens working toward a more just society. Sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

I hope the break from the semester\u2019s\r\nroutine was restful and restorative.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe that two years have passed since the start of the\r\nglobal pandemic. No one can possibly account for the anxiety, stress, and\r\ncollective loss we have experienced through this period. Nor measure the\r\ncreativity, ingenuity, and sheer goodwill that has kept us all moving\r\nforward. I remain ever grateful to our staff in student life and our\r\npartners at Hartford HeathCare, who have gone to extraordinary lengths to\r\nkeep our campus safe; to our faculty, staff, and student leaders who have\r\nhelped us refine our protocols and make better decisions; and to all of you\r\nfor your forbearance and faith.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are again, about to embark on yet another semester with COVID\r\nin our midst. Yesterday, you received a message\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/campus-life/student-health-services/coronavirus/coronavirus-communications/students/spring-2022-covid-19-plans-jan-15-2022/>\r\nfrom the College with details about our approach to the start of the new\r\nterm. I am writing today to reflect on what this means for us as a\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nOur foremost concern has always been your health and safety. This semester\r\nis no different. The only thing that has changed is our accumulated\r\nexperience of living with COVID. By now we know that vaccines and boosters\r\nare effective in preventing serious illness; that indoor masking inhibits\r\ncommunity spread; and that regular testing is useful for monitoring both\r\nindividual and campus health. Our plans for the start of 2022 include\r\ncontinuing all these protocols to protect each other and our extended\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe recent surge of Omicron makes this necessary. We expect to see a larger\r\nnumber of positive cases as everyone returns to campus next week, and our\r\nplans, including remote instruction for the first week, are designed with\r\nthis in mind. We want to ensure that operations continue so that\r\neveryone\u2014students, faculty, and staff\u2014can participate as fully as possible\r\nat the start of the term in order to achieve their goals for the rest of\r\nthe semester.\r\n\r\nOf course, there will be disruptions as people test positive and isolate,\r\nor as local schools close and parents are forced to adjust. This will add\r\nstress to an already stressful time. I ask simply that we all exercise an\r\nextra measure of compassion, flexibility, and understanding with each other\r\nover the next few weeks. As we have seen time and again, when we come\r\ntogether as a community of empathy and care, we are able to do the good\r\nwork that ultimately fulfills us and our educational mission.\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing you on campus in the coming days.

He will begin his new role Jan. 31.\r\n\r\nRodmon brings to Conn two decades of professional experience in higher\r\neducation. Trained as a philosopher, he earned a B.A. from Roberts Wesleyan\r\nCollege, and a M.A. and Ph.D. in Ancient Philosophy from the University of\r\nRochester.

Rodmon moved to Centre College\r\nin 2015, transitioning fully into administration as associate vice\r\npresident for academic affairs and diversity initiatives. From there, he\r\nwas recruited to SUNY, where he was tasked with creating the first division\r\nof diversity, equity, and inclusion at Oswego while taking on roles of\r\nincreasing responsibility for the SUNY system as a whole.\r\n\r\nAt Oswego, he has been responsible for elevating the College\u2019s strategic\r\nefforts around equity, including the launch of a three-year Grand Challenge\r\non race, racism, and social justice and the design of a new Institute for\r\nEquity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Transformative Practice. He has worked\r\nwith student government and countless student leaders on equity\r\ninitiatives; directed the university\u2019s DEI Advisory Council; chaired the\r\nBIPOC faculty and staff coalition; and made efforts to improve city-campus\r\nrelations with leaders in the City of Oswego. As Deputy Chief Diversity\r\nOfficer for the SUNY system, he has helped design and assess DEI plans;\r\nchaired the system\u2019s Diversity Advisory Council; and launched a new Native\r\nAmerican Initiative. He has also served in a leadership capacity on other\r\nSUNY campuses when circumstances have required it.\r\n\r\nAs our new Dean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion, Rodmon will be\r\nresponsible for advancing full participation as a strategic priority at\r\nConnecticut College. This includes implementing the next phase of the\r\nCollege\u2019s Equity and Inclusion Action Plan; overseeing the ongoing strength\r\nof Unity House, the LGBTQIA Center, the Women\u2019s Center, Hillel House, and\r\nthe Chapel; and supporting a strong team of professional staff in their\r\nwork on equity and compliance, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality,\r\nreligion and spirituality, accessibility services, bias education and\r\nresponse, sexual violence prevention, and intergroup dialogue\u2014all in order\r\nto improve the experience of an increasingly diverse student body, faculty,\r\nand staff. I am thrilled that Rodmon King will bring his talent, intellect,\r\nand deep commitment to full participation to the leadership of our campus.\r\n\r\nI want to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the search\r\nprocess, with a special note of appreciation to Maria Cruz-Saco, the Joanne\r\nToor Cummings \u201950 Professor of Economics, and Erika Smith, Dean of the\r\nCollege, who co-chaired the search, and to all the members of the committee\r\nwhose good work and steady judgment\u2014over the course of two\r\nsemesters\u2014brought about this outcome: Debo Adegbile \u201991, Chair of the Board\r\nof Trustees; Hubert Cook, the Sue and Eugene Mercy, Jr. Assistant Professor\r\nof English; Ricardo Lombera \u201922, 2021 Chair of Equity and Inclusion for the\r\nStudent Government Association; Meera Narayanan-Pandit \u201923, Vice President,\r\nConnecticut College Athletes of Color Coalition; Ken Prestininzi, Associate\r\nProfessor of Theater; Analisse Rios \u201908, Strength and Conditioning and\r\nAssistant Women\u2019s Soccer Coach; Jefferson Singer, Faulk Foundation\r\nProfessor of Psychology and past Dean of the College; and Bryana White,\r\nAssistant Director, Student Counseling Services.\r\n\r\nI also want to express my deep gratitude to Ari Rotramel, Vandana Shiva\r\nAssociate Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and Intersectionality Studies,\r\nwho paused a sabbatical to take on the role of interim dean, a position\r\nthey have fulfilled with talent and conviction since August.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] A Message from the President"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, we wrote to you about a report we had received of a student\r\nbeing photographed without consent while showering in Katherine Blunt\r\nHouse. This egregious and unacceptable behavior is not tolerated at\r\nConnecticut College. We immediately informed New London Police, initiated a\r\nformal ongoing investigation, and increased campus safety patrols on\r\ncampus. Most important, we engaged in vital conversations with student,\r\nstaff, and faculty leaders not only about ways to address this incident,\r\nbut also about the broader need for sexual violence prevention, education,\r\nand advocacy at Conn.\r\n\r\nI am writing to follow up on these conversations and to apprise you of the\r\nimmediate and long-term steps we are taking to ensure that our campus\r\nremains a safe place for all.\r\n\r\n\u2014First, and most immediately, we will make a series of additional\r\ninterventions to enhance safety and privacy in residence hall bathrooms.\r\nAmong the changes to be made:\r\n\r\n   - Locks will be installed in single bathrooms that are not currently\r\n   lockable\r\n   - Upper windows in Larrabee bathrooms will be frosted\r\n   - Any remaining gaps in stalls will be filled\r\n   - Architectural studies will be conducted to identify other future\r\n   solutions\r\n   - New mounted signage will include the 24/7 On-Call Line for the\r\n   confidential Sexual Violence and Prevention Advocate:  460-9194\r\n\r\n\u2014Second, we will expand opportunities for education about sexual violence.\r\nIncreased funding for the Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Advocacy\r\nwill support enhanced educational programming. And the deans will establish\r\nadditional regular venues for engaging students in education and training\r\nbeyond new student orientation.\r\n\r\n\u2014Third, we will update the College\u2019s Equity and Inclusion Action Plan with\r\nspecific goals, objectives, and actions related to ending sexual violence\r\nand promoting a culture of sexual respect. The dean of institutional equity\r\nand inclusion will appoint a committee at the beginning of the spring\r\nsemester who will make recommendations on the revised plan.\r\n\r\n\u2014Fourth, we will build on the critical investments we have made in recent\r\nyears by expanding the staff focused on sexual violence prevention,\r\nadvocacy, training, and education for the whole campus. The dean of the\r\ncollege, the vice president for human resources, and the dean of\r\ninstitutional equity and inclusion will work collaboratively on this\r\nstaffing, designed to augment resources, training, and outcomes for\r\nstudents, faculty, and staff.\r\n\r\nFinally, through these efforts, the College will redouble its support of\r\nsurvivors and will also do more. We ultimately want to end sexual violence\r\non this campus through building a deep culture of respect and humility\u2014and\r\na true community of care\u2014where the well-being of every individual is\r\nparamount. This is the only way we will realize our vision of full\r\nparticipation. I am grateful to the students, staff, faculty, and\r\nadministrative leaders who will help us on this journey. And, of course,\r\nall of us are responsible for creating the culture we seek.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Message from President Bergeron on Going Green"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nOver the past two weeks, we experienced our latest challenge as an\r\ninstitution navigating the uncertainties of an ongoing pandemic: a\r\nprecipitous rise in cases of COVID-19 at the College that were quickly\r\nreduced thanks to your hard work. This week, we have returned to Green, and\r\nI want to recognize that success and thank you for your sacrifices and your\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIt took determination to achieve this outcome. With purpose and mutual\r\nobligation\u2014and with many public health professionals by our side\u2014we were\r\nable to turn the tide and avert a crisis. I know this work asked a lot of\r\neveryone. I know that not everyone agrees with all the choices this\r\npandemic has forced us to make. I also know that when we come together as a\r\ncommunity of empathy and care, we are able to accomplish the work that\r\nfulfills our educational mission. I am writing today to reflect on what the\r\npast week has taught us and to envision our work ahead.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we have now seen first-hand how the full array of prevention and\r\nmitigation measures\u2014vaccination, masking, testing, contact tracing,\r\nisolating, and more\u2014protects our community from undue harm. A nearly 100%\r\nvaccination rate among our students proved beneficial in dealing with the\r\nmore contagious Delta variant and averted serious illness. Universal indoor\r\nmasking helped prevent the spread of the virus in classrooms and other\r\npublic settings. Regular surveillance testing allowed us to identify and\r\nisolate positive cases quickly. Contact tracing confirmed how and where the\r\nvirus moved through our campus. And temporary limits on the size of student\r\ngatherings served to curtail broader community transmission.\r\n\r\nI want to acknowledge our staff in student life, in dining, and in\r\nfacilities who worked long hours and assumed extra duties to support and\r\ncare for affected students; our faculty who transitioned to remote teaching\r\nin order to continue the robust experiences that set Conn apart; our\r\nstudents who dealt with changes to their academic, co-curricular, and\r\nsocial life; and our staff across every division\u2014whether performing duties\r\non campus or remotely\u2014who helped keep Conn moving forward. Because of your\r\nresolve, we saw infections drop, with only one student testing positive on\r\nFriday, and no new cases at all among faculty and staff. That is something\r\nto remember and to commend.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, just as we see the pandemic causing divisions in our society, we\r\nhave seen frustrations emerging within our own community, divergences of\r\nopinion representing the many unique circumstances of our different\r\nmembers. As we go forward, I want to underscore how vitally important it is\r\nfor us to come together to reframe our common work. This, in short, is an\r\nopportunity for us to approach the pandemic anew, to ensure our future\r\nsuccess and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nFor Conn is not simply a campus where talented students live and learn; or\r\nwhere exceptional faculty realize their passion for teaching and\r\nscholarship; or where dedicated staff bring the highest standards of\r\nprofessional service. We are all of this and more\u2014a college whose mission\r\nof educating future leaders makes us greater than the sum of our parts.\r\nEach of us brings our own perspectives and experiences, with families and\r\nfriends that we love and look after. This includes all of us with health\r\nchallenges or with family members at special risk. To prevail through these\r\ntimes means working even harder to keep these differences in view while\r\nhonoring our collective responsibility. And that, again, requires empathy:\r\nthe capacity to reframe our work toward our greater mission, our common\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nOur work together toward that common purpose harnesses the full power of\r\nthis community and its mission. And I am optimistic we will succeed because\r\nthis is Conn.\r\n\r\nWith good wishes and gratitude on our return to Green,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] A Message from the President"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Campus Community,\r\n\r\nTen days ago, as I welcomed you at Convocation\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/meet-our-president/speeches/107th-convocation/>\r\nto\r\na new academic year, I enjoined all of us to \u201cbe more\u201d as a community. You\r\nhave certainly answered that call in the past few days, responding with\r\ngenerosity and understanding as we made the rapid shift to Alert Level\r\n3-Orange on Tuesday. I want to thank you for that and, as this week comes\r\nto a close, review what we are doing to return to normal operations as\r\nquickly and safely as possible.\r\n\r\nBefore the start of the semester, we reinstated our rigorous testing\r\nprotocol as an added layer of protection for our community in light of the\r\nmore contagious Delta variant. Students experiencing symptoms were tested\r\nat Student Health Services, helping us detect the initial rise in cases,\r\nand our regular PCR testing in Dayton Arena made it possible for us to act\r\nquickly to reduce community spread:\r\n\r\n   - All students who tested positive were moved to isolation housing to\r\n   safeguard the rest of the community. Because nearly all of the positive\r\n   students, like our student body, are fully vaccinated, they have been\r\n   experiencing milder symptoms for the most part. No one is hospitalized. I\r\n   am grateful to our staff in student life and dining for the care they have\r\n   been providing to everyone.\r\n\r\n   - Contact tracing allowed us to identify members of the community who\r\n   may have had close interactions with the students who tested positive.\r\n\r\n   - Classes resumed Wednesday in a remote format that will continue\r\n   through the beginning of next week. I am grateful to our faculty and\r\n   students, too, for adapting so quickly to this temporary change.\r\n\r\n   - To reduce spread even further, we implemented new protocols across\r\n   campus. Masks are one of the most effective means to stop airborne\r\n   transmission of the virus. As another temporary measure, we limited the\r\n   size of student social gatherings.\r\n\r\n   - Finally, we asked all students to curtail travel beyond the campus\r\n   gates, while encouraging everyone to take advantage of our incredible\r\n   grounds for outdoor socializing and dining. As I walk about the campus, I\r\n   can see students taking that advice to heart.\r\n\r\nOur local department of public health and our partners at Hartford\r\nHealthCare have strongly supported these measures. We are hopeful that the\r\nsteps we are taking will result in a declining number of cases. As we see\r\ndownward trends, we should be able to relax restrictions and return to more\r\nnormal operations. If we all pull together that could happen even sooner. I\r\nknow we can do it.\r\n\r\nIn my Convocation address, I asked us not to forget what a precious thing\r\nit is to call this college our home; not to forget how much compassion is\r\nrequired to remain in community during trying times. I know this week has\r\nchallenged us all, but it has also shown what this community is capable of.\r\n\r\nOur amazing staff in student life have not only been running a testing\r\ncenter for the second year in a row, but also ferrying students to\r\noff-campus locations, making daily health checks, and supporting our\r\nstudents in so many ways.\r\n\r\nOur staff in dining have been preparing food for pick up on campus and\r\ndelivering meals to student rooms.\r\n\r\nOur staff in custodial services have been taking extra care to ensure the\r\ncleanliness of our buildings.\r\n\r\nOur staff in the dean of the college, DIEI, the ARC, the Walter Commons,\r\nthe Hale Center, and beyond have been advising students about every\r\npossible concern.\r\n\r\nOur staff in communications have been keeping everyone informed.\r\n\r\nOur staff in the library have been supporting all modes of instruction.\r\n\r\nAbove all, our faculty have been organizing talks and lectures, holding\r\nauditions and rehearsals, and delivering the highest caliber of teaching\r\nonline.\r\n\r\nAnd our students, as ever, have been open, generous, and resilient.\r\n\r\nAcross all these groups I have seen countless acts of individual kindness\r\nand expressions of care for the well-being of all. Together, you have\r\ndemonstrated what it means to be more as a community.\r\n\r\nThese are not normal times, but clearly we are all learning to adapt. With\r\nyour continued commitment, I know we will be able to return to campus life\r\nas we were living it when this school year began. Thank you for doing\r\neverything you can to make that happen soon.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

Her last day will be Sept. 3.\r\n\r\nWe have been able to appoint Mary Keeney, an experienced HR professional\r\nand formerly Vice President for Human Resources at the State University of\r\nNew York, to serve the College in an interim capacity starting Sept. 8. A\r\nsearch for a permanent successor will begin immediately.\r\n\r\nCheryl came to lead the Office of Human Resources in 2008 with a plan to\r\nstay for five years, but the strong ethos of our community called to her\r\nand she ended up staying thirteen. During her tenure, the College launched\r\nits first staff professional development programs; regularized the process\r\nof assessing salaries; expanded employee health benefits; and implemented\r\nbest practices for managing insurance and retirement plans. The HR Office\r\nintroduced many business process improvements as well, including new online\r\nsystems for applicant tracking, benefits enrollment, and payroll\r\nauthorization.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with the Dean of the Faculty and the Dean of Institutional\r\nEquity and Inclusion, Cheryl was instrumental in creating new\r\nanti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies while also introducing\r\nrequired training in sexual harassment prevention within a changing Title\r\nIX landscape. With the Vice President of Finance, she helped establish the\r\nStrategic Position Review Committee to ensure that College resources were\r\nbeing used effectively. With the Secretary of the College, she implemented\r\na new online portal for Board communications. And with the Staff Council,\r\nshe enabled a new paid parental leave policy; expanded the terms of\r\nbereavement leave for staff; and advanced the Presidential Staff awards\r\nprogram. Beyond campus, she brokered an important Memorandum of Agreement\r\nwith the United States Coast Guard Academy allowing the sharing of\r\nfacilities, personnel, and other resources. In all these ways, she\r\ndemonstrated extraordinary commitment to this College.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Cheryl joined my office to provide support to the cabinet, the\r\nSecretary of the College, and the Board, while continuing to oversee HR.\r\nShe was an invaluable resource to all of us as we worked through the myriad\r\nchallenges of operating a College during a public health crisis. She\r\ndrafted new policies to support staff who could not perform their duties\r\nremotely; established COVID leave to provide for families dealing with\r\nillness; and helped usher in a new partnership with Hartford HealthCare to\r\nmanage College medical services. We are grateful for the loyalty, wisdom,\r\nand compassion she has brought to every aspect of her work.\r\n\r\nWith Cheryl\u2019s departure, I have asked Amy Dooling, associate dean for\r\nglobal initiatives and professor of East Asian Studies, to take on an\r\nexpanded role as dean of strategic and global initiatives in order to\r\ncontinue building inter-institutional partnerships and strengthening global\r\nteaching and research, while also supporting my office, the senior\r\nadministration, and the Board of Trustees in the advancement of College\r\npriorities. Amy will begin her new duties on Sept. 6.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we have retained the executive search firm Carrington &\r\nCarrington <https://www.carringtonandcarrington.com/> to assist us in\r\nfinding the next Vice President for Human Resources. I will share more\r\ninformation about the search process when it becomes available.\r\n\r\nThere will be a gathering on Cheryl\u2019s last day, Sept. 3, to honor her\r\ncontributions to Connecticut College. Details about that event are\r\nforthcoming. For now, please join me in expressing our gratitude to Cheryl\r\nand our good wishes to her family.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

He joined Connecticut College in\r\n2014 as an on-call cook in Catering and Dining, and was promoted five years\r\nlater to catering sous chef.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can think of few people more committed to our students than Yul. Even as\r\nan on-call employee, he made it a point to attend Commencement every year,\r\njust to celebrate the seniors he had come to know through catering events\r\nor working late night shifts at Oasis. I will never forget the time during\r\nthe blizzard of 2015, with no buses running, Yul walked to the College from\r\nhis home in New London because, as he said at the time, \u201csomebody had to\r\nfeed those kids.\u201d And in March 2020, when the Mayor of New London asked the\r\nCollege for volunteers to help school children access the meals they could\r\nnot get in lockdown, Yul was one of the first to sign up. He believed that\r\nit was the responsibility of every dining staff member to make a positive\r\ndifference in the lives of students, and he lived out that conviction every\r\nday. In the process, he touched so many people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur trustees benefited from his special talents during Board of Trustee\r\nweekends. A familiar presence at Saturday morning breakfasts, Yul was known\r\nfor his exquisite made-to-order omelets and his ebullient spirit, which\r\nalways set the tone for the day. I always looked forward to the times when\r\nhe came to oversee events at our house on 772 Williams Street, because I\r\nknew not only that the food would be delicious but also that our kitchen\r\nwould be filled with the warmth of his giant personality. His death is a\r\nreal blow to our community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the new semester begins, we will hold a gathering on campus to\r\ncelebrate Yul\u2019s life with staff, students, faculty, and members of his\r\nfamily. Information about that event will be shared as soon as it is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who are grieving, please know there are many places to turn for\r\nsupport. Students may reach an off-site licensed professional clinician at\r\nno cost by calling Student Counseling Services . College\r\nemployees may access counseling through the HigherEd Employee Assistance\r\nProgram <http://www.higheredeap.com> .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the College, I want to express my deepest condolences to Yul\u2019s\r\nfamily: his son, Jonathan; his daughter-in-law Erin; his four grandchildren\r\nand his one great granddaughter; as well as the many friends he left behind\r\nboth here on campus and in the region.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

I am writing today with news of some forthcoming personnel changes.\r\nAs you know, Erin Duran, director of gender and sexuality programs, has\r\nbeen serving as interim dean of institutional equity and inclusion since\r\nthe departure of John McKnight in June. Erin recently informed me that,\r\nstarting in August, he will be taking a new position as the assistant vice\r\nprovost for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging at the University\r\nof Kansas. His last day at Conn will be Aug. 6.\r\n\r\nAs Erin departs, I am pleased to report that Ariella Rotramel, the Vandana\r\nShiva Associate Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and Intersectionality\r\nStudies, has graciously agreed to interrupt a sabbatical to succeed Erin in\r\nthe role of interim dean. Ari will begin Aug. 1, and will continue until a\r\npermanent dean is appointed. Having worked closely not only with Erin but\r\nalso with nearly every staff member in the division of institutional equity\r\nand inclusion, Ari is a natural choice to follow him in the interim role. I\r\nwant to thank both Erin and Ari for their commitment to the division during\r\nthis period of transition.\r\n\r\nI also want to take a moment to acknowledge Erin\u2019s notable contributions\r\nover the past five years. In a word, he made a real difference to the\r\nCollege. As the first full-time director of gender and sexuality programs,\r\nhe worked closely with staff and faculty campuswide to create a welcoming\r\nenvironment for people of all identities. He helped rewrite policies;\r\ncreated new protocols for gender-inclusive language; developed new programs\r\nrelated to LGBTQIA and women\u2019s empowerment; and worked with Advancement to\r\nincrease alumni engagement. A fierce student advocate, he also partnered\r\nproductively with student ambassadors to transform the LGBTQIA and Women\u2019s\r\nCenters into vibrant community hubs for education and dialogue,\r\nestablishing two new Conn traditions\u2014the Lavender Graduation and the Pride\r\nRally\u2014that will continue long after he is gone.\r\n\r\nErin was a trusted voice, too, on Staff Council, most recently serving as\r\nchair-elect. He contributed to the CARE Team; served as a confidential\r\nadvocate for survivors of sexual violence; and was a staff adviser for two\r\nFirst-Year Seminars. He took on a critical leadership role with the Agnes\r\nGund \u201960 Dialogue Project, training student and faculty leaders and\r\nsupporting the creation of the student podcast In CONNversation.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful for all he has done for our community. I ask you to join me\r\nin thanking Erin for his service and wishing him well in his new position.\r\nI also ask you to thank Ari for stepping in to oversee the important work\r\nof the division as we continue our search for a new dean.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] The Passing of Melissa Shafner"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,  It is with great\r\nsadness that I write to inform you of the passing of Melissa Shafner,\r\ndirector of student accessibility services, who died yesterday after an\r\nextended illness. Melissa was a wonderful student advocate, a consummate\r\nprofessional, and a trusted colleague to many at the College, and we deeply\r\nmourn her loss.  A longtime resident of New London, Melissa was a Winthrop\r\nScholar who graduated from Connecticut College in 1990 summa cum laude with\r\ndepartmental honors in psychology. She then went on to earn her J.D. at\r\nHofstra University School of Law before completing a M.Ed. at the\r\nUniversity of New Haven. Melissa rejoined the College in 2016 as the\r\ndirector of student accessibility services, working first within the\r\nAcademic Resource Center and then moving in 2019 to the division of\r\ninstitutional equity and inclusion. In that role, Melissa oversaw academic\r\nand residential accommodations; handled policies and procedures to ensure\r\nfull participation for all students; and provided education about ability\r\nfor the whole community.  In short, Melissa had a tremendous impact on our\r\ncampus. She worked with so many staff and faculty colleagues to support\r\nstudents with disabilities in and out of the classroom. She established and\r\nchaired a campuswide committee on accessibility to bring not only her\r\nequity-mindedness but also her legal expertise to promote policies and\r\nprocedures that were most fair to all. She took on the major task of\r\nconverting her office from paper to electronic transactions, in order to\r\neliminate the need for students to share their request for accommodations\r\nin a public space. She led sessions among like-minded students to offer\r\nsupport, connection, and community building. She even partnered with\r\nstudent leaders to bring a chapter of Eye to Eye\u2014a group focused on\r\nmentorship for the differently abled\u2014to our campus. Her work with the local\r\ncommunity was similarly transformative. As a long-serving member of the\r\nBoard of Solomon Schechter Academy, Melissa made a lasting difference. When\r\nthe academy announced its final graduating class in June 2021, it was\r\nMelissa who received the accolades for helping the school\u2019s programs carry\r\non for so many years. Those who worked closely with Melissa know of her\r\nincredible work ethic; her dedication to students; her ability to navigate\r\ndifficult situations; and her skill at asking the hard questions that can\r\npush an issue or an organization to a new level. She was an intelligent,\r\ndiligent, and deeply thoughtful colleague with extensive knowledge of her\r\nfield and a profound commitment to Connecticut College. It is difficult to\r\nimagine our community without her.  Those who wish to pay their respects\r\nare invited to attend services tomorrow, Thursday, July 1 at 12:30 p.m., at\r\nNeilan\u2019s Funeral Home in New London.

A larger gathering is planned for the fall to\r\nallow all students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to celebrate\r\nMelissa\u2019s life together. Information about that event will be shared as\r\nsoon as it is available.  I want to remind you that there are many places\r\nto turn for support.

This is a telephone-based\r\n   mental health service that is available to all students in need of access\r\n   to mental health support when Student Counseling Services is not open. This\r\n   service provides students with access to an off-site counselor who will\r\n   provide support during the summer break.\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   My SSP : Download the free My SSP App,\r\n   available on the App Store or Google Play. Through the app, you can call or\r\n   chat with a Student Support Counselor 24/7 in real-time or schedule a\r\n   telephone or video session that fits your schedule. My SSP provides support\r\n   in the event of a personal crisis and also connects students with\r\n   providers, offering both short and long-term counseling. You may also call\r\n   My SSP directly at 866-743-7732 (or from outside North America at\r\n   001-416-380-6578).

It has been an intensive process\u2014and a\r\ngood one\u2014with the very competitive market for chief diversity officers\r\nacross the country making this search unfold a bit differently than most.\r\n\r\nTo review: the search committee considered applications from a number of\r\npromising candidates, some of whom ended up receiving offers from other\r\ninstitutions before we could invite them for a campus interview. In the\r\nend, as you know, we brought two candidates for virtual campus visits \u2014 one\r\nbefore Commencement and the other a few weeks later. The second, Kijua\r\nSanders-McMurtry, Vice President for Equity and Inclusion at Mount Holyoke\r\nCollege, came for her virtual interview on June 16 and returned for an\r\nin-person visit last week. An offer was extended to Kijua and, following a\r\nperiod of reflection, she let us know that she had decided to remain at\r\nMount Holyoke.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, disappointing news. But we will carry on. Now that\r\nsummer is upon us, we plan to take the next couple of months to rebuild the\r\ncandidate pool and then recommence the search at the beginning of\r\nSeptember. Our search consultant from Witt Kieffer is continuing to support\r\nus in this effort. I have asked our excellent search committee, too, to\r\nstay on until the process is complete. I want to thank the co-chairs\r\nJefferson Singer and Maria Cruz-Saco, as well as all the members of the\r\ncommittee\u2014Debo Adegbile \u201991, Hubert Cook, Ricardo Lombera \u201922, Meera\r\nNarayanan-Pandit \u201923, Analisse Rios, and Bryana White\u2014for all the energy\r\nthey have dedicated to this important process. I hope you will join me in\r\nthanking them, too.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your participation thus far and I look forward to your\r\ncontinued involvement in the fall.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

What began as a local Texas tradition has grown into a\r\nnationwide observance recognized in 49 states and the District of Columbia.\r\nOn Wednesday, Congress voted to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, and on\r\nThursday, President Biden signed it into law.\r\n<https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/16/politics/house-vote-juneteenth-federal-holiday-senate-passed-june-19/index.html>\r\n\r\nIt is a day with a profound lesson of \u201cfreedom deferred and then found,\u201d as\r\nKevin Young, the Mellon Director of the National Museum of African American\r\nHistory and Culture, has suggested. We want to encourage all of you to take\r\ntime tomorrow to reflect on the meaning of this day in your own way,\r\nthrough readings, stories, food, or music. If you are on campus or living\r\nnearby, you can attend the launch of the New London Community Dream Market\r\n<https://www.nlcdream.market/> and the Juneteenth Jubilation celebration\r\n<https://m.facebook.com/events/380440836716529> taking place from 4-7 p.m.\r\non Mercer Street in New London.

A little\r\nover a year ago, following the murder of George Floyd, we wrote a letter\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/meet-our-president/letters--statements/letters/our-commitment.html>\r\noutlining\r\nour plan to promote anti-racist education in our community as part of our\r\ncommitment to full participation. This included ten goals\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/equity-inclusion/action-plan/priorities-and-progress/anti-racist-education-and-action-c-2020/>\r\nthat expanded the list of action items published in the College\u2019s Equity\r\nand Inclusion Action Plan.

Below is a\r\nsummary:\r\n\r\nAnti-Racist Education in Campus Safety and Law Enforcement\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The Student Life Division reallocated two staff positions in Campus\r\n   Safety to create two new student support specialists who will work\r\n   collaboratively with safety officers and other campus staff to address\r\n   student issues during the evening and late night hours. Connecticut College\r\n   is the first among its peer institutions to adopt this enhanced approach to\r\n   community wellbeing.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The Dean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion and the Dean of Academic\r\n   Support designed a comprehensive anti-bias training for Campus Safety\r\n   officers and implemented the training in fall 2020. The Department\r\n   continues to enhance its education efforts in the areas of anti-bias and\r\n   anti-racism.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The Mayor of New London asked John McKnight to chair an\r\n   intergenerational task force, the New London Public Safety Policy Review\r\n   Committee, in the summer of 2020, with Mary Savage, Director of Campus\r\n   Safety, and Clayton Potter, Community Learning Coordinator, serving as\r\n   representatives. The group concluded its work in January 2021 with a report\r\n   to the New London Mayor and City Council. Several recommendations are\r\n   currently being implemented, including a significant budget increase for\r\n   the city\u2019s Human Services Department. This article\r\n   <https://www.theday.com/local-news/20210115/committee-recommends-civilian-police-review-board-in-new-london>\r\n   contains detailed information.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our public lecture series Conversations on Race, in partnership with The\r\n   Day, continued during the pandemic with a dynamic virtual event in January\r\n   2021 focused on racial bias in policing. Guests included Debo Adegbile \u201991\r\n   and a group of local panelists providing national context on the issues of\r\n   police and community relations. Conversations on Race will continue in the\r\n   2021-22 academic year.\r\n\r\nAnti-Racist Education in Teaching and Learning\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Students, staff, and faculty completed a required online training\r\n   program that provided foundational concepts about diversity, equity, and\r\n   inclusion. The EverFi training modules, completed by the majority of campus\r\n   in 2021, will be offered annually to new community members. Additional\r\n   content will be created to expand educational opportunities in the coming\r\n   year.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   A new graduation requirement on Social Difference and Power\r\n   <https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/degree-requirements/connections/social-difference-and-power-courses/>\r\n   was established with the Class of 2024.

The staff\r\n   also delivered a new module for the First-Year Seminars on developing\r\n   effective behaviors as allies in the work of social justice.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Many campus academic departments and offices created statements of\r\n   solidarity with the BIPOC community, with links to educational resources.\r\n   These included student leaders\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DNoqSyJpiEXOP0D3f7T2xEKEP4uOe2yEMcBcl43r8pU/>\r\n   ; faculty and staff\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwEFBBdhPT44XUWzKqGmuiuvAbZyUoyDGpqr6hxr3t4/>\r\n   allies; the department of Psychology\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEjwnPlhBxawzM3339qLKSYZxQCT_tN31dDLeDCKhf4/>\r\n   ; Student Counseling Services\r\n   <https://www.conncoll.edu/campus-life/student-counseling-services/>; and\r\n   the resources found on this page\r\n   <https://www.conncoll.edu/equity-inclusion/action-plan/priorities-and-progress/anti-racist-education-and-action-c-2020/>.\r\n   The Division of Institutional Equity and Inclusion will be collating all\r\n   these resources into a single comprehensive guide to be posted on its\r\n   website <https://www.conncoll.edu/equity-inclusion/> this summer.\r\n\r\nAnti-Racism and Campus Climate\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The College disseminated the national Higher Education Data Sharing\r\n    Consortium campus climate survey this past spring. After receiving\r\n   the full report from HEDS this summer, including comparative data from\r\n   other institutions, we will share the results with the campus community in\r\n   the fall.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The DIEI team established a committee of student, staff, and faculty\r\n   representatives to review the College\u2019s bias policies and protocols and\r\n   make recommendations for improvement. An anticipated shift will be toward\r\n   providing bias education as a preventive measure and refining modes of\r\n   reporting. The committee\u2019s work is still underway.\r\n\r\nReflecting on our collective work is vital at the end of this year of\r\ncrisis and loss, when questions of racial equity and justice were foremost\r\nin our minds. And while we mark progress in our efforts, we also\r\nacknowledge that we have far to go to live up to our ideal of full\r\nparticipation, where all members of our campus are able to thrive and\r\ncontribute meaningfully to the flourishing of others. May this Juneteenth\r\nholiday be an occasion to reflect, recommit, and return to this work with\r\nrenewed vigor as we come together again as a community in the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

It is painful because we see history\r\nrepeating and our justice system failing again and again.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Announcing Fall 2021 Plans"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nAs we come to the end of our sixth straight week in Alert Level 1-Green, I\r\nwant to commend you for helping keep our campus safe and our COVID levels\r\nlow\u2014indeed, as low as we have ever seen them. You have shown us what is\r\npossible when a community comes together to do the right thing. In that\r\nspirit, I am writing today to share with you our plans for fall 2021.\r\n\r\nWe have now entered a critical new phase in combatting the pandemic:\r\nwidespread distribution of a vaccine. Faculty and staff at Conn are on\r\ntheir way to being fully vaccinated and 95 percent of our students in a\r\nrecent survey reported that they either have received the vaccine or intend\r\nto receive it soon. College-aged students in Connecticut become eligible\r\ntoday, and the state has said it may be able to make the one-dose Johnson &\r\nJohnson vaccine available to our students by early May.\r\n\r\nAll this is good news. Achieving a high community vaccination rate will\r\nenable us to resume normal campus operations in the fall. I have heard from\r\nmany faculty, staff, and students who are eager to do just that.\r\n\r\nAnd so I want to reaffirm our goal for fall 2021: to be teaching, working,\r\nand learning together in person. Our partners at Hartford HealthCare have\r\nconfirmed that, with the vaccine, we can return to normal classroom seating\r\ncapacity. And that means our fall class schedule will no longer include\r\nremote or hybrid classes.\r\n\r\nReturning to campus is essential for our community and for the integrity of\r\nour mission as a residential liberal arts college.\r\n\r\nThrough it all, our highest priority has never changed: ensuring your\r\nhealth and safety. And so, even with a vaccinated campus, the College will\r\nbe maintaining two important COVID-19 protocols in the fall: universal\r\nmasking and large-scale testing.\r\n\r\nThere are many details still to work out\u2014about housing, dining, and much\r\nelse\u2014as we retransition to a fully residential campus. The chairs of our\r\nthree COVID-19 working groups, along with representatives from Staff\r\nCouncil, FSCC, and SGA will begin meeting again soon to study the issues,\r\nevaluate the data, and make the recommendations necessary for our success.\r\n\r\nPreliminary information about our plans can be found on a new webpage\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/campus-life/student-health-services/coronavirus/summer-and-fall-2021-information/>\r\non\r\nthe The Path Forward website.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] The Passing of Isabel Sanhueza \u201923"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nIt is with deep sorrow that I write to let you know that Isabel Sanhueza,\r\nfrom the Class of 2023, passed away Thursday night at her home in New\r\nHaven. She was 24. We send our deepest condolences to Isabel\u2019s mother and\r\nstepfather, Rebecca Sanhueza and Richard Behar, and to all who knew and\r\nloved her.\r\n\r\nIsabel was a brilliant student who had just transferred to Conn from\r\nGateway Community College in New Haven. She loved her new college and,\r\nalthough attending remotely, she was thriving here, with a perfect academic\r\nrecord that earned her not only dean\u2019s high honors in her first semester\r\nbut also, in her second, a coveted place as a scholar in the Holleran\r\nCenter. A double major in anthropology and government, she was a talented\r\nthinker and writer, passionate about the intersection of scholarship,\r\ncommunity action, and public policy. She had a dream of becoming a medical\r\nanthropologist, like her grandmother. Professor Ari Rotramel, who worked\r\nwith her in the Center, witnessed firsthand her excitement to be part of a\r\npassionate group of Holleran scholars, and noted that Isabel had \u201calready\r\ndemonstrated that she viewed them as her colleagues and was excited to\r\nlearn from them and support them. It was abundantly clear that she had the\r\nintelligence, maturity, and humility to become a strong leader for justice\r\nin our world. I am heartbroken that we have lost the opportunity to watch\r\nher grow, but I am thankful to have known her and will take with me her\r\nability to bring hope and curiosity alongside grounded knowledge into her\r\nlearning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHer anthropology adviser, Professor Joyce Bennett, described her\r\n\u201csophisticated understanding of how intersectionality and activism come\r\ntogether\u2014so rare in a young person. She was the kind of student you want to\r\ntalk to all the time, because she was not just learning from you but also\r\npushing you to be a better mentor and teacher.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer government adviser, Professor Tristan Borer, put it simply: \u201cIsabel was\r\njust so smart. She added immeasurably to our class discussions in two\r\nsemesters on two very different topics. It was an honor and a privilege to\r\nknow her, if only for a short while.\u201d\r\n\r\nIsabel was an active citizen in her life beyond school. She spent many\r\nhours volunteering at soup kitchens, nursing homes, and retirement\r\nfacilities. In New Haven, she worked for a time for an organization called\r\nMusical Intervention that provided clients with access to musical\r\ninstruments and recording equipment. She was a living example of our\r\nmission of putting the liberal arts into action. We grieve the loss of this\r\nbeautiful young life, dedicated to the flourishing of others.\r\n\r\nIn this unprecedented year, filled with too much loss, please remember that\r\nthere are many places to turn for support. Students who are on campus and\r\nneed immediate support should call Campus Safety at  439-2222, and\r\nthey will, in turn, connect you with our on-call Student Life staff. Anyone\r\nneeding help may also reach an off-site licensed professional clinician at\r\nno cost, in two different ways:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Counseling After Hours: Call the Student Counseling Services phone\r\n   number  and press option 2 or 3. This is a telephone-based\r\n   mental health service that is available to all students in need of access\r\n   to mental health support when Student Counseling Services is not open. This\r\n   service provides students with access to an off-site counselor who will\r\n   provide support during any evening, weekend or break.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   My SSP : Download the free My SSP App,\r\n   available on the App Store or Google Play. Through the app, you can call or\r\n   chat with a Student Support Counselor 24/7 in real-time or schedule a\r\n   telephone or video session that fits your schedule. My SSP provides support\r\n   in the event of a personal crisis and also connects students with\r\n   providers, offering both short and long-term counseling. You may also call\r\n   My SSP directly at 866-743-7732 (or from outside North America at\r\n   001-416-380-6578). The My SSP app offers a digital library of articles and\r\n   videos that you may find helpful.\r\n\r\nOur Counseling staff will be available for appointments next week. College\r\nemployees should know, too, that they may speak to professional counselors\r\nany time of the day or night through the HigherEd Employee Assistance\r\nProgram by calling 800-252-4555. Additional resources can be found at\r\nwww.HigherEdEAP.com <http://www.higheredeap.com/>.\r\n\r\nIsabel was a talented young woman of great integrity, intelligence, and\r\npromise. There will be an occasion to mark her life here at Connecticut\r\nCollege in the coming weeks and we will write again with more information\r\nas it becomes available. In the meantime, please join me in extending our\r\ndeepest sympathies to her family.\r\n\r\nWith empathy,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

His last day at Conn will be June 30.\r\n\r\nWe have benefited greatly from John\u2019s talents as an administrator,\r\neducator, and communicator. In the time since he arrived in New London, he\r\nhas helped Connecticut College significantly advance our strategic goals\r\naround equity, inclusion, and full participation. Notable accomplishments\r\nduring his tenure include the development of a strong, integrated team of\r\nprofessional staff and student leaders; the publication of a comprehensive\r\nEquity and Inclusion Action Plan; the launch of the Agnes Gund \u201960 Dialogue\r\nProject; the founding of a new public lecture series on race; the\r\nratification of a curricular requirement on social difference and power;\r\nthe release of a seminal report on police reform in the City of New London;\r\nand the creation of the first annual conference on social justice at\r\nConnecticut College. It is not surprising that, in our recent campus-wide\r\nreview of our strategic plan, *Building on Strength*, these achievements\r\nwere seen as among the most significant of the last five years.\r\n\r\nClearly, as a community, we have come far under John\u2019s leadership. Our\r\nevolution is the result of a whole network of people\u2014students, faculty,\r\nstaff, administration, alumni, trustees, and local community\r\npartners\u2014working together toward a shared vision. John helped to inspire\r\nthat collective effort, and we should all be grateful. I certainly am.\r\n\r\nWe will now begin the process of identifying John\u2019s successor, and I will\r\nwrite again with more information as it becomes available. Later this\r\nspring, of course, there will be occasions to recognize John\u2019s many\r\ncontributions to Connecticut College.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we cannot rest. We have much more work to do together to\r\nrealize our goal of *full participation*: the vision of a campus and\r\ncommunity where all people can thrive, reach their potential, and\r\ncontribute to our greater good. The work of so many within our community\r\nover several years summons us to do more. I remain deeply committed to\r\nadvancing this project with you and to doing our part in creating a more\r\nequitable and just society.\r\n\r\nFor now, please join me in sending thanks and best wishes to John and his\r\nfamily as they embark on their next chapter.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Jan. 18, the College will be closed in observance of the\r\nnational holiday commemorating Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople tend to remember Dr. King in vastly different ways. He is best\r\nknown, of course, as the face of one of the most powerful social movements\r\nin modern history\u2013\u2013the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Historians paint\r\nMLK as a visionary, a servant leader, a fiery preacher, and an unrivaled\r\norator, whose unwavering commitment to non-violent resistance led to wide\r\nscale legislative and social change in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Dr. King was also a critical thinker, a lifelong student of social\r\nmovements, and an agitator. Toward the end of his life, when he spoke of\r\nthe \u201ctriple evils\u201d of racism, militarism, and capitalism, he challenged the\r\nstatus quo of American life and culture. By then, many had come to see his\r\nincreasingly radical ideas as a threat. His prophetic last speech, \u201cI\u2019ve\r\nBeen to the Mountaintop,\u201d presaged a life that was about to come to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow, then, do we properly commemorate Dr. King\u2019s life and legacy in 2021\u2013\u2013a\r\nyear that, already in its first days, has secured a place in the annals of\r\nAmerican history both for its advances and for its violence? For example,\r\nafter unprecedented levels of voter participation, we will witness the\r\ninauguration of the first Black, South Asian, and female vice president of\r\nthe United States, along with several other firsts in electoral politics.\r\nAnd yet the progress has also provoked a deadly backlash, as the shameful\r\nevents of Jan. 6 have shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this context, it seems all the more vital that we reflect on Dr. King\u2019s\r\nlegacy with the same critical lens that he trained on the world, fully\r\nalive to the tensions that come with social change. We should use this\r\nmoment, in other words, to study social movements, practice cross-cultural\r\ndialogue, engage in nonviolent resistance, and dare to lead in the face of\r\nfear and uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe week after next, the Division of Institutional Equity and Inclusion is\r\ncreating an opportunity for us to do just that. From Jan. 25\u201427,\r\nConnecticut College will host Elevate <http://elevate.conncoll.edu/>, our\r\nfirst annual conference on social justice. The event will feature a diverse\r\ngroup of educators and activists who, following King\u2019s example, are leading\r\nsocial movements of many kinds. We will hear from Charlene Carruthers, a\r\nmodern-day leader in the movement for Black liberation. We will hear from\r\nShalini Kantayya, investigating the bias coded in our technology. We will\r\nhear from Jonathan Mooney, an outspoken advocate for reimagining\r\ndisability. And we will hear from nationally recognized interfaith educator\r\nEboo Patel, reflecting on the vital intersection of race and religion.\r\nPatel will deliver the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Address on\r\nJan. 25, at 11 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElevate will also raise up the voices of our students, faculty, and staff\r\nthrough workshops, panels, and group discussions. A full schedule\r\n<http://elevate.conncoll.edu/schedule/> for Elevate is online and\r\nregistration <http://elevate.conncoll.edu/schedule/schedule-glance/> is now\r\nopen.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Our Vital Civic Duty"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Campus Community,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not stopped thinking about the disturbing events that took place in\r\nthe U.S. Capitol Wednesday. As the House and Senate met to tally the\r\nelectoral college votes for the 46th president, a riotous mob, enflamed by\r\nweeks of incendiary rhetoric, breached the halls of Congress to overturn an\r\nelection they believed, without evidence, to have been stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike many of you, I watched the chaos with fear and shame and disbelief as\r\ndeadly violence overwhelmed law enforcement and halted the count. And while\r\nthe marauders were eventually expelled and Congress reconvened to complete\r\nits work, the damage was done. Beyond the ransacked offices and humiliated\r\nofficials, the violation of one of our most sacred ceremonies\u2014the peaceful\r\ntransfer of power\u2014also exposed the fragility of our democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me, it was the lowest point in an unprecedented 12 months marked by the\r\ntwin pandemics of coronavirus and systemic racism. And in that context, one\r\ncould not help but notice the relative deference shown to white extremists\r\ndesecrating a hallowed public space, by contrast to the aggression\r\nunleashed last summer on peaceful protesters marching in support of Black\r\nlives. Among other things, the disparity shows exactly how steep our climb\r\nto equity and justice will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it also shows that our mission as a College\u2014to educate citizen leaders\r\ncapable of sustaining a democratic society\u2014has never been more important.\r\n\r\nThat is what I have been reflecting on as we prepare for a new semester.\r\nThe events of this week may have shaken our confidence. They may have\r\nraised existential questions about who we are or why we do what we do. But,\r\nto me, they have also laid bare our vital civic duty as a College\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn August, when I welcomed the class of 2024\r\n<https://www.conncoll.edu/welcome-weekend/welcome2024/>, I talked about\r\nthree ways to embrace that duty: by protecting the health of our neighbors;\r\nby exercising fully our democratic rights; and most importantly, by taking\r\nthe opportunity to learn and practice the art of dialogue. As we enter\r\n2021, I am asking us to recommit to this work.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have a unique opportunity to do that together this year. On\r\nthe week of January 25, Connecticut College will host Elevate\r\n<http://elevate.conncoll.edu/>, our first annual conference on social\r\njustice. The conference\u2019s many workshops, lectures, films, and discussions\r\noffer a way for you not only to channel your concerns but also to deepen\r\nyour engagement with the issues and with each other. Please review the\r\nschedule <http://elevate.conncoll.edu/schedule/>, register for at least one\r\nevent, and become part of the dialogue.\r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] The Passing of Hans Horst-Martz \u201921"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Campus Community,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with profound sorrow that I write to relay the news that Hans\r\nHorst-Martz, from the Class of 2021, died Wednesday while at home on winter\r\nbreak. His family has asked us to share with you that the cause of death\r\nwas suicide and they want you to know that there are many resources,\r\ndescribed below, for those who may be struggling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an unimaginable loss for our community. My heart goes out to Hans\u2019s\r\nmother and father, Jenny Anne and Galen, his wonderful sister Emma \u201918, and\r\neveryone who knew and loved him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHans was a very special person. From the moment he arrived on campus, he\r\nshowed himself to be a deeply committed, creative, and engaged scholar who\r\nbrought energy and conviction to every aspect of his life and work. A\r\ndouble major in Botany and Environmental Studies, he lived out his passion\r\nfor environmental justice not just through courses but also through his\r\nwork as a fellow in our Office of Sustainability; through two summers of\r\nindependent botany research; and through extended studies of regenerative\r\nfarming and community agriculture in Australia, in western Vermont, and\r\nright here on campus in our Sprout garden. But Hans was equally passionate\r\nabout building community, a commitment that was as evident in his service\r\nto the Student Government Association as it was in his leadership on our\r\nUltimate Frisbee team. In all these ways, he enriched our College, in the\r\nwords of one of his professors, Chad Jones, \u201cas an amazing student and an\r\namazing friend.\u201d We mourn the loss of this brilliant and gifted young life,\r\nand convey our deepest condolences to Hans\u2019s family, his faculty and staff\r\nmentors, his closest friends, and to all those whose lives he touched over\r\nthe past four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is especially painful news to share on the first day of a new year,\r\nduring a time when we are separated from one another over an extended\r\nwinter break. Hans\u2019s family has expressed their wish to have a service to\r\nremember him later in the spring \u2014 when warmer weather resumes and it is\r\nsafe to gather in person \u2014 in the Sprout garden or in the Arboretum or in\r\none of the places he loved. In the days to come, our chaplains will also be\r\nplanning a special PAUSE event in his honor. You will receive more\r\ninformation about that soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost important, though, Hans\u2019s family would like those of you who are\r\ngrieving or who may be struggling with depression to know that there are\r\npeople you can turn to. Students who are on campus and need immediate\r\nsupport should call Campus Safety at 860-439-2222, and they will, in turn,\r\nconnect you with our on-call Student Life staff. Any students needing\r\nurgent help may also reach an off-site licensed professional clinician at\r\nno cost, in two different ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Counseling After Hours: Call the Student Counseling Services phone\r\n   number  and press option 2 or 3. This is a telephone-based\r\n   mental health service that is available to all students in need of access\r\n   to mental health support when Student Counseling Services is not open. This\r\n   service provides students with access to an off-site counselor who will\r\n   provide support during any evening, weekend, or break.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   My SSP : Download the free My SSP App,\r\n   available on the App Store or Google Play.

Additional resources can be\r\nfound at www.HigherEdEAP.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nHans was a person of enormous talent, wisdom, and compassion and his death\r\nis a terrible blow. His family asks everyone in our community to take\r\nspecial care with one other by taking the time to ask about the wellbeing\r\nof students and friends, so people know they are not alone, that they have\r\nyour love and support. This will be the first and most appropriate way to\r\nhonor Hans\u2019s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith empathy,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\n\r\n*Katherine Bergeron*\r\n\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nOffice of the President 860-439-2666 <8604392666>\r\n270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320\r\n<https://maps.google.com/?q=270+Mohegan+Avenue%C2%A0%C2%A0+%7C+%C2%A0%C2%A0New+London,+CT+06320>\r\n\r\nView this email in your browser   |   Update your preferences   |\r\nUnsubscribe\r\n\r\n"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Invitation to Review Building on Strength"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Faculty, Students, and Staff,\r\n\r\nConnecticut College adopted its strategic plan, *Building on Strength*, in\r\nNovember 2016, as a 10-year vision for increasing the College\u2019s academic,\r\nresidential, community, and financial resources. We are now approaching the\r\nmidpoint of the plan\u2019s expected 10-year timeframe, and so we are taking\r\nstock. When the plan was designed in 2015-16, we invited the involvement of\r\nthe whole Connecticut College community. I am writing today to ask again\r\nfor your informed reflection on what has been achieved and what remains to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nYou can do this in the form of a short survey.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] News About the Dean of the College"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Students,\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that Dean Singer has informed me of his\r\ndecision to step down from his role as dean of the College in June 2021, at\r\nthe end of a distinguished six-year term. After a sabbatical, he plans to\r\nreturn to teaching in the department of psychology.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, bittersweet news for me to relay. Dean Singer has been\r\nan exceptional colleague and leader. When he took on the role of dean in\r\nJuly 2015, he was carrying a big responsibility to ensure the success of a\r\nnew curriculum\u2014Connections\u2014that the faculty had ratified the previous May.\r\nTo say that he discharged that duty with distinction is an understatement.\r\nOur second annual All-College Symposium, held just last November, is one\r\npiece of evidence, with its brilliant display of student talent. The 70\r\npercent of students in the Class of 2023 who have now voluntarily enrolled\r\nin Centers and Pathways is another piece. The 92 percent of the Class of\r\n2024 who said Connections was the main reason they chose Conn is yet\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhen we created Connections, we always imagined that it would become a\r\ndistinguisher for the College, which is exactly what has happened. And we\r\nhave Dean Singer to thank for his graceful stewardship of this important\r\nproject. He has done it all in his inimitable way\u2014by working\r\ncollaboratively with staff and faculty colleagues and always, always on\r\nbehalf of you, our students. I have never known a greater champion for\r\nstudent learning and success than Dean Singer.\r\n\r\nThere will be occasions in the coming months to acknowledge Dean Singer's\r\nmany contributions as dean. But I hope you will join me now in thanking him\r\nfor all he has done for Connecticut College.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to launch an internal search for the next dean early in the New\r\nYear. I will be working with the Faculty Steering and Conference Committee\r\n, Staff Council, and SGA to put a representative committee together.\r\nI hope to have a formal announcement of the position before the holiday\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I send you all my own good wishes for a successful end of\r\n2020 and a restful Winter Break.

{"prompt": ["[class2023] Announcing the 2021 Commencement Speaker"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to announce that Ethan Brown \u201994, founder,\r\npresident, and CEO of Beyond Meat, will deliver the keynote address at the\r\nCollege\u2019s 103rd Commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 23, 2021.\r\n\r\nBrown, one of the newest members of the Connecticut College Board of\r\nTrustees, majored in Government and History at Conn while competing on the\r\nmen\u2019s basketball team and serving as publisher of the Connecticut College\r\nReview. He went on to earn an MBA at Columbia and a Master of Public Policy\r\nat the University of Maryland. This combination of history, policy,\r\nbusiness, journalism, and competitive sports would prove to be a formidable\r\nfoundation for his future career.\r\n\r\nPassionate about the environment, Brown first held leadership roles at\r\nBallard Power Systems, the world\u2019s leading hydrogen fuel cell developer.\r\nWhile working in the alternative energy industry, he had a revelation about\r\nthe environmental impact of livestock production, an insight that led him,\r\nin turn, to imagine an alternative meat industry. After discovering a\r\nUniversity of Missouri researcher who was re-engineering plant-based\r\nproteins to mimic animal tissue, Brown took his knowledge of business and\r\npolicy to the laboratory. And, with support from Bill Gates and others, in\r\n2009 he created a new company, Beyond Meat.\r\n\r\nTen years later, in May 2019, that company made its public debut. The first\r\nplant-based food company to go public on a major exchange, Beyond Meat\r\nclosed its first day of trading 163% above its initial valuation, making it\r\nthe best performing first-day IPO in decades. Today, the company\u2019s\r\nvaluation stands at about $8.75 billion, and Brown has found vindication\r\nfor his core belief that businesses can be both successful and socially\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nBrown\u2019s devotion to creating a better world has been evident in all his\r\ncommitments. He founded a center for fuel reformation and has served in\r\nprominent leadership positions in renewable energy, including as vice chair\r\nof the Board at The National Hydrogen Association and secretary of the U.S.\r\nFuel Cell Council. The Aspen Institute named him a Henry Crown Fellow\u2014a\r\ndistinction reserved for young entrepreneurs who demonstrate leadership\r\ndriven by a spirit of community. In 2018, he received the United Nation\u2019s\r\nhighest environmental recognition\u2014the Champion of the Earth award.\r\n\r\nHis address to the class of 2021 should be a perfect culmination of the\r\nwork being advanced this year both by the Office of Sustainability, with\r\nits theme of \u201cNourishing Community,\u201d and by students in our new Food\r\nPathway.\r\n\r\nDuring the commencement ceremony, the College will also confer on Brown an\r\nhonorary doctorate of humane letters *honoris* *causa*, an award that\r\nreflects his achievements as an entrepreneur and an environmentalist who\r\nhas fulfilled our mission of putting the liberal arts into action.\r\n\r\nI want to thank all who served on the 2021 Commencement committee\u2014co-chairs\r\nBonnie Wells and Madison Smith \u201921; Marc Forster, College Marshal and the\r\nHenry B. Plant Professor of History; Anne Bernhard, associate dean of the\r\nfaculty and the Katherine Blunt Professor of Biology; Virginia Anderson,\r\nassociate professor of theater; Luci Chaplin, associate director of alumni\r\nengagement; Tiffany Thiele, national media relations manager; and Cameron\r\nAaron, Koby Giglietti, Nicole Poole, and Sara Topalovic, all from the Class\r\nof 2021.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to state my fervent hope to hold our 103rd Commencement on\r\ncampus. In a year of ongoing uncertainty, all our decisions will continue\r\nto be guided, of course, by state and federal public health leaders.\r\n\r\nNo matter how we choose to celebrate, it will be an honor to welcome Ethan\r\nBrown.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}

{"prompt": ["[class2023] News from the October 2020 Board of Trustees Meeting"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut College Board of Trustees came together via Zoom for its\r\nfall meetings Oct. 21\u201324. As our strategic plan enters its fifth year, the\r\nfull Board focused attention on how the College has achieved distinction in\r\nthree priority areas: the academic program, the student experience, and\r\nsustainability and justice. Trustees also discussed developments in career\r\neducation, admission and recruitment, equity and inclusion, and faculty\r\nadvancement; as well as current and future capital projects, College\r\nfinances, and fundraising. This letter summarizes the range of issues\r\ndiscussed and actions taken.\r\n\r\nEight alumni were welcomed as new or returning members of the Board: Maria\r\nWyckoff Boyce \u201985, Ethan Brown \u201994, Gregory Gigliotti \u201988, Steven Jacobson\r\n\u201985 P\u201922, and Leslie Rosen \u201902 as new trustees; Jonathan McBride \u201992 and\r\nPamela Zilly \u201975 returning for another term of service; and Shyanne Temple\r\n\u201920 as our Young Alumni Trustee. The meetings coincided with the sixth\r\nannual convening of the Council of Former and Emeritus Trustees, with\r\nrecord turnout. In a year when the country has faced the ongoing challenge\r\nof a public health emergency, an economic downturn, and a racial justice\r\ncrisis, it was meaningful to have board members past and present in\r\nconversation about our common aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Building on Strength*Friday\u2019s plenary session offered an opportunity for\r\ntrustees to review our strategic plan: what we wanted to accomplish and\r\nwhat we have done since the plan was approved in the fall of 2016. The\r\nbroad discussion centered on the impact of the plan in advancing\r\nintegrative education, career development, and full participation, and,\r\nespecially, on how these distinctive aspects of the Conn experience are\r\nbeing communicated to prospective students and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe theme of equity, inclusion, and full participation informed many of the\r\nweekend\u2019s presentations. The Committee on Academic Affairs spent time\r\nconsidering the College\u2019s new Social Difference and Power requirement with\r\nthree faculty leaders: Deb Eastman, associate professor of biology; Cherise\r\nHarris, associate professor of sociology and co-director of the Center for\r\nthe Critical Study of Race and Ethnicity; and Sufia Uddin, professor of\r\nanthropology and religion. The discussion touched both on the purpose and\r\nevolution of this long-desired curricular development, expressed in our\r\nstrategic plan, and on its implementation with the Class of 2024.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Student Experience took on the issues of federal Title IX\r\nlegislation, campus climate, and the ongoing work of the new Agnes Gund \u201960\r\nDialogue Project. John McKnight, dean of institutional equity and\r\ninclusion, reviewed the College\u2019s plan for mandatory racial bias training\r\nfor students, faculty, and staff to be implemented starting in November.\r\nTrustees also learned about the elements of the College\u2019s new Career Action\r\nProgram, another equity-minded initiative whose purpose is to enhance the\r\nability of every student to find success in their lives after College.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Capital Projects and Information Security*The Facilities and\r\nInfrastructure Committee focused attention on the considerable work\r\nundertaken since the spring to prepare for a safe reopening of the campus,\r\nincluding not just the opening of our own testing center but also\r\nadjustments to classrooms, dining spaces, and residence halls in accordance\r\nwith state guidelines.\r\n\r\nVice President for Information Services and College Librarian Lee Hisle\r\ndescribed the work done by the IS team over the last eight months to help\r\nfaculty, staff, and students navigate the ongoing challenges of the\r\npandemic. Trustees also heard from John Schaeffer, chief information\r\nsecurity officer and director of networks, systems, and security, and Jean\r\nKilbride, associate vice president for enterprise and technical systems,\r\nabout the College\u2019s information security environment. Results of a recent\r\nexternal assessment gave Conn high marks for its information security\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\nPart of the conversation was reserved for our most recent capital project:\r\nthe Nancy Athey \u201972 and Preston Athey Center for Performance and Research\r\nat Palmer Auditorium. This renovation, undeterred by the pandemic, has been\r\nsupported by leadership gifts from the Atheys and the Sherman Fairchild\r\nFoundation. The construction is currently on track and the building\r\nscheduled to open in fall 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Finances and Fundraising*The Finance Committee reviewed the College\u2019s\r\nresults for fiscal year 2020, which, once again, ended with a balanced cash\r\noperating budget. The impact of COVID-19 on budget and enrollment planning\r\nfor fiscal year 2021 and 2022 was a major focus of discussion, along with\r\nfinancial projections for the coming year. Conn\u2019s endowment weathered the\r\nvolatile markets in 2020, maintaining a value of $325 million as of June 30.\r\n\r\nThe Trustees acknowledged receipt of several new gifts in support of\r\nfaculty and student scholarship: $286,615 from the National Science\r\nFoundation to support Peter Siver, the Charles and Sarah P. Becker \u201927\r\nProfessor of Botany and Environmental Studies, and his evolving research on\r\nfossils; $93,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support the Mellon\r\nMays Undergraduate Fellowship Program; $34,829 from the Social Science\r\nResearch Council to support the research of Assistant Professor of\r\nGovernment Mara Suttmann-Lea on voter education in the digital age; and a\r\n$10,000 seed grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to support E. Carla\r\nParker-Athill, assistant professor of biology, and her research on the\r\nbiological impact of childhood trauma.\r\n\r\nEven in an unprecedented year, the College raised a record $6.4 million for\r\nthe annual fund. The Advancement Committee reviewed progress on the\r\nCampaign, which in its quiet phase has now raised over $130 million in new\r\ngifts and commitments. The Connecticut College Fund for 2021 is off to a\r\nsolid start this year with $2.7 million raised against a goal of $6.4\r\nmillion. The College is fortunate for the generosity of a small group of\r\ncurrent and emeriti trustees, who created a $1 million fund to offset\r\nCOVID-19 expenses, a gift that is now inspiring other alumni to support the\r\nCollege during a challenging year.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Other business*The Board recognized faculty promotions for four head\r\ncoaches: Matthew Anderson, head coach of men\u2019s and women\u2019s water polo, to\r\nadjunct assistant professor; Christina Chappell, head coach of women\u2019s\r\nfield hockey, to adjunct associate professor; Kristin Steele, head coach of\r\nwomen\u2019s ice hockey, to adjunct professor; and James Ward, head coach of\r\nmen\u2019s ice hockey, to adjunct professor.\r\n\r\nFour trustees who recently completed their terms of service\u2013Bradford T.\r\nBrown P\u201912 \u201915 \u201920, Sarah H. Fenton \u201963, Mark M. Iger \u201975, and Annie M.\r\nScott \u201984\u2013were awarded the title trustee emeritus in recognition of their\r\nmeritorious efforts on behalf of the College.\r\n\r\nFinally, Zoe Klein Henriquez \u201999 and Maria Pellegrini \u201969 were inducted as\r\nthe newest members of the Ad Astra Society in a special online ceremony\r\nattended by the Board, the Council of Former and Emeriti Trustees, and the\r\nsenior administration.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Katherine Bergeron*\r\nPresident"}
{"prompt": ["[class2023] Veterans Day Remembrance"], "completion": "\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nTomorrow is Veterans Day, a U.S. holiday that recognizes and honors those\r\nwho have served their country.\r\n\r\nConnecticut College has a long history of supporting those who have served.\r\nStudents in our very first class\u2013the Class of 1919\u2013supported the First\r\nWorld War in numerous ways. And, when Armistice was declared on Nov. 11,\r\n1918, our students marched downtown to join the sailors, soldiers, and\r\nresidents of New London in a citywide parade.\r\n\r\nGiven our history and our close proximity to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy\r\nand the Naval submarine base, the Conn community perhaps has a greater\r\nknowledge of\u2013and appreciation for\u2013military service than people on many\r\nother college campuses. There are a number of veterans among our staff,\r\nfaculty, and students, and you may know people in your immediate or\r\nextended family who served. Whatever your situation, I encourage all of you\r\nto take a moment tomorrow to reflect on the meaning of this kind of service.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of this day, two of our staff who are veterans, Interim\r\nDirector of Facilities and Utilities Tom Hobaica and Senior\r\nProgrammer/Analyst Mary Vona, along with one of our veteran students,\r\nBrandon Boyd \u201921, will join me for an 8:30 a.m. flag-raising ceremony by\r\nthe Gatehouse. It will be a meaningful way to mark the beginning of\r\nVeterans Day. Should you wish to attend, please remember that masks and\r\nsocial distancing are expected.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Office of Religious and Spiritual Programs will focus\r\ntheir weekly PAUSE event, this Thursday at noon, on commemorating Veterans\r\nDay.

{"prompt": ["Remembering Elizabeth Babbott Conant \u201851"], "completion": "Remembering Elizabeth Babbott Conant \u201851\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nI am writing to convey the sad news that Elizabeth Babbott \u201cBabs\u201d Conant \u201951 passed away on Aug. 23 at her home in Buffalo. She was 91. A former Connecticut College professor, dean, and member of the Board of Trustees, Babs was a brilliant intellect and self-described serial activist whose life after Connecticut College took her around the world as an indefatigable teacher and advocate for peace and justice. The world has lost a remarkable spirit.\r\n\r\nConant was an evolutionary zoologist who fought her whole life for civil rights. In the 1960\u2019s, she joined the Freedom Riders to challenge segregation in the Jim Crow south. During the Vietnam War, she staged a protest in a cage to speak against the torture of prisoners of war. In 2012, after New York legalized same-sex marriage, she married her partner of three decades, Camille Cox, and went on to train thousands of student teachers on the importance of safe classrooms for LGBTQIA students.\r\n\r\nShe was born in Brooklyn, NY on July 7, 1929, the youngest of Frank and Elizabeth French Babbott\u2019s five children. After graduating from Conn in 1951 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in zoology, she earned her master\u2019s and then a doctorate in biology from Radcliffe College in 1956, and in the same year moved to Japan to take up a post at the International Christian University in Tokyo. She returned to Connecticut College in 1958 at the invitation of Rosemary Park to serve as assistant professor of vertebrate zoology, dean of sophomores, and international student advisor.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, she left Conn for a position at the University of Nigeria, in Nsukka. That was where she began her work on the African lungfish, for which she became internationally known. For the next two decades, her academic career would take her to Wellesley, the University of Virginia, Mary Baldwin College, The University of Buffalo, and finally Canisius College, where she arrived in 1982 and stayed until her retirement.\r\n\r\nShe served as a trustee of Connecticut College from 1982-1992, and in 1995 was awarded the College Medal  , the highest honor we bestow. In 2002, The Lear-Conant Symposium was established with a gift from one of her dearest friends, the historian and biographer Linda J. Lear \u201962. \u201cI first knew her as the sophomore dean,\u201d Lear said, \u201cand while she could be tough as nails when need be, her laugh was infectious, her voice strong and compelling, and as a friend there was no one finer or more trustworthy.\u201d Lear went on: \u201cShe had an extraordinary mind, was an adventurous, challenging leader, and a woman of great compassion and faithfulness.\u201d The Symposium, a biennial conference in the Goodwin-Niering Center for the Environment, carries on the legacy of this unrivaled scholar-activist.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the College, I want to extend my deepest condolences to Babs\u2019 wife Camille, to her stepchildren Tara, Miya, and Ethan, and to everyone in the Connecticut College community who loved her. A tribute to her life will take place at the next Lear-Conant Symposium on March 6, 2021.\r\n\r\nWith empathy,\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

{"prompt": ["A Message from the President"], "completion": "A Message from the President\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nThis week marks the launch of a new academic year, a historic year, with faculty, students, and staff participating in classes, meetings, and activities from both on-campus settings and remote locations across the region, across the country, and across the world. Honestly, it feels like a small miracle to have reached this point. To restart this fall in the midst of a pandemic represents a monumental achievement\u2014perhaps the most remarkable feat of institutional reimagining we have ever known.\r\n\r\nAmong the noteworthy accomplishments: We entered into a partnership with Hartford HealthCare  to enhance and integrate medical services across the College. We opened our own COVID-19 testing center  and, in a little over two weeks, successfully tested almost 4,500 individuals  studying and working on campus. We developed an entirely new online orientation  to launch the 13 new transfers and the 437 members of the extraordinary Class of 2024, before welcoming them in a special live-streamed event  . We created new signage and messaging  to support everyone\u2019s safety and reorganized our dining\r\noperation into a convenient takeout service  . We redesigned cleaning protocols in residence halls and public spaces; rearranged classrooms and residences for social distancing; installed tents across campus for informal teaching and gathering; and enhanced our green spaces with new plantings and dozens of new Adirondack chairs so more students can enjoy the expansive lawns of Tempel Green. Even more critically, we reimagined our entire academic schedule as a flexible mix of in-person, remote, and hybrid courses, then developed new tools and technology infrastructure to support that vision. We reorganized our athletic program  for a year in which NESCAC competition will be curtailed. Finally and most importantly, we held two online summits  to\r\nadvance the campus dialogue about our institutional commitments  to full participation and anti-racist education, not just to improve our own environment but also to give our students the critical perspective they need to change the world.\r\n\r\nAll this was accomplished in a summer like no other\u2014or, more accurately, in one continuous push from mid-May to the first week of September. We could never have pulled it off without the steadfast commitment of staff and faculty across every division of the College, working both here and remotely, including those in admission and financial aid who brought in a first-year class overwhelmingly claiming Connecticut College as their first choice. There were students, too, who joined faculty and staff in our integrated working groups  and met throughout the summer to consider every detail of our operations. I want to thank all of you for your excellence, your inspiration, and your dedication to this College.\r\n\r\nThe Year Ahead\r\nA primary goal for the coming year is now to execute on these carefully laid plans: in short, to complete a successful and healthy fall semester and then repeat that success in the spring. If all continues to go well, onboarding quarantine for students will end and in-person classes will begin Sept. 11. The learning experience of the coming weeks will, in turn, inform the faculty\u2019s deliberation about the spring. As before, you will find all important decisions about spring 2021 on ourPath Forward website. \r\n\r\nBuilding on Strength\r\nThankfully, not all our planning this year will be around COVID-19. One of the most important lessons learned in the last six months has been how quickly, as a College, we were able to reimagine our work. Many of the innovations that we needed for the new remote teaching and learning environment have proved valuable, and colleagues across campus are now thinking about how to leverage them in the future.\r\n\r\nThe rethinking is timely. Our strategic plan, Building on Strength,  released four years ago in fall 2016, drew on the collective wisdom of the College community in order to guide decisions and actions for the next ten years. I invite you to read the most recent progress report .pdf) for the academic year 2019-20. The plan is now entering its fifth year\u2014the halfway point\u2014and so it is fitting that we take a moment to review goals and progress to see how they have evolved.\r\n\r\nWe will do that as a community this year, working through our major governance committees and with our Board of Trustees. You will receive more information later this month. Two very thoughtful reports I received over the summer\u2014from the Priorities, Planning, and Budget Committee and from the special working group on Study Away\u2014offer ideas and recommendations that will be helpful to this review process, especially as they relate to specific goals within the strategic plan.\r\n\r\nCapital Projects\r\nOne of the major projects called for in Building on Strength is the revitalization of Palmer Auditorium, to advance the College\u2019s distinction in the creative and performing arts. Funds were raised for this project in 2018; architectural plans completed in 2019; and construction commenced in June 2020 with A/Z Corporation  . Those of you who are on campus can see the work now underway on the building\u2019s exterior. The project is scheduled to be complete by fall 2021. We are so fortunate that Jim Norton, former director of facilities management at Connecticut College, has agreed to come out of retirement to help us oversee this historically informed renovation.\r\n\r\nCampaign\r\nThe funds for the renovation were raised as part of the comprehensive campaign for Conn launched in fall 2017. Over the last three years we have made good progress on our campaign goals. Even with the economic challenges brought on by COVID-19, our community remained steadfast in its philanthropic support last year, helping us reach a $6M annual fund goal to ensure a balanced budget at year\u2019s end. The campaign raised $14M in new gifts and commitments in 2019-20, bringing its three-year cumulative total to nearly $128M. The coming year includes an even more ambitious goal.\r\n\r\nConvenings\r\nTo conclude, I want to announce a few opportunities for the campus to come together in the coming weeks. The first is the visit of Joy Harjo, author of Crazy Brave, the beautiful memoir assigned to our incoming students this year.

You may register for the virtual event here  .\r\n\r\nSecond, because of the required quarantine, our opening-of-school Convocation could not take place as in previous years. Sunday\u2019s welcome event for new students fulfilled the function in part. But we would like to hold this important ritual later in the fall. The date we are saving is Thursday, Oct. 1, just before our virtual Fall Weekend. You will be receiving more information about this event soon.\r\n\r\nThird, I want to remind you that our second annual All-College Symposium  will take place in a new online format this year, on Thursday, Nov. 5, 2020. Please mark your calendars to be inspired as you witness our students demonstrating how they have learned to put the liberal arts into action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing all of you in the coming weeks either online or on campus. In the meantime, I wish you a healthy and successful start to this historic new year.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

{"prompt": ["Announcing Racial Equity Summit"], "completion": "Announcing Racial Equity Summit\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Students,\r\n\r\nThere is no question that 2020 will go down as an unparalleled time in our history, a year of untold challenge and suffering. Beyond the story of this country\u2019s most consequential public health crisis in a century, what will history say about the unrelenting crisis of racism in America? How will it account for the exponential growth of citizens joined in a global movement calling for racial justice and equity?\r\n\r\nWe hope the story that will be told goes beyond the memorializing of anti-Black violence. We hope, instead, it will be a story of awakening, of transformation, and of progress toward reconciliation and healing. Connecticut College intends to be part of that story.\r\n\r\nSince our last communication in June  , we have thought deeply about the accounts and personal and painful experiences of racism shared publicly by students and alumni. We have also reflected on many social media messages, emails, letters, and phone calls from students and alumni calling for enhanced protections for survivors of sexual violence, undocumented persons, and international students.\r\n\r\nWe respond first by acknowledging the pain that people of color in our community have felt when subjected to words or deeds that may undermine their flourishing at Connecticut College and the experiences of Black students and colleagues in particular. We understand the exasperation and fatigue so many of you have expressed. But we also know that acknowledgment is not sufficient. We are prepared to act with additional anti-racist initiatives necessary to create the inclusive culture called for in our 2017 strategic plan  , with its central priority of full participation; and spelled out with greater depth and focus in our 2019 Equity and Inclusion Action Plan  , with its vision of a more just and equitable community. We now bring renewed emphasis to these commitments to meet the call of this moment.\r\n\r\nNext week, we will host a special online event for current students called Where Do We Go From Here?: A Summit on Racial Equity at Connecticut College. The summit is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 19 from noon to 1:30 p.m. . The goal, in part, is to discuss the progress we have made on both the Equity and Inclusion Action Plan and our anti-racist commitments from earlier this summer. We invite you to join the dialogue via this Zoom link  to learn how you can contribute to racial justice on our campus.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to working together with you to write a history that will make you and future generations of Connecticut College students proud.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nJohn McKnight\r\nDean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

{"prompt": ["Statement in Support of International Students"], "completion": "Statement in Support of International Students\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nToday, the College issued the following statement affirming our commitment and support for our international students, in response to new operational guidance from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .\r\n\r\nWe have been in contact with affected students in the last several days to offer support and to answer questions. Should you have questions about support or resources available, I encourage you to reach out to Dean Carmela Patton.\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone for their continued support of our international students during this pandemic and beyond. It means a lot.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement by Connecticut College on recent guidance issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\r\n\r\nOn July 6, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  announced pending regulation that would compromise the visa status for international students attending colleges that offered only online instruction in the fall. The guidance represents an incomprehensible reversal of the position established by ICE just a few months ago, and appears, to quote from a recently filed lawsuit, \u201cas cruel as it is capricious.\u201d Connecticut College opposes both the letter and the spirit of the proposed regulation.\r\n\r\nOur international students are highly valued members of our community. They bring unique linguistic, cultural, and geographic perspectives. They are prominent scholars and campus leaders. They contribute actively to the New London community. The mission of Connecticut College is to educate students to put the liberal arts into action as citizens of a global society. We cannot begin to fulfill that mission without the vibrant presence of our international students.\r\n\r\nTo promote the health and safety of our entire community, the Connecticut College faculty adopted a curriculum for the fall that represents a mix of in-person and remote teaching, and as such, our international students may be less affected by the proposed regulation. We are nonetheless acutely aware of the pain, confusion, and fear the new guidance has caused\u2014at a time when we continue to deal with the harmful effects of a global pandemic.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call on ICE to revise its guidance and to allow international students to return to or remain in the United States in order to advance their coursework in whatever modality it may be offered.\r\n\r\nWe have been and will continue to be in communication with our NESCAC colleagues and with those at other colleges and universities about our collective efforts to assist our students. As a member of the President\u2019s Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration  , we are also monitoring developments in Washington, D.C., and will be reaching out to the American Council on Education and other higher education organizations to keep apprised of opportunities to have input with legislators around this issue.\r\n\r\nIn short, our faculty, staff, and senior administration are committed to doing everything we can to support our students and to preserve the integrity of our international community.\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

{"prompt": ["New Connecticut College-Hartford HealthCare Partnership"], "completion": "New Connecticut College-Hartford HealthCare Partnership\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Students,\r\n\r\nAs we continue to prepare for your return to campus in the fall, your health and safety remain our highest priority. We are writing today to provide you with news about an exciting new development in Student Health Services  and Sports Medicine for next year.\r\n\r\nHartford HealthCare  and Connecticut College today announced a new partnership that will provide you with even more comprehensive healthcare on campus.\r\n\r\nBeginning in August, HHC will become the provider for our student health and medical services in SHS and Sports Medicine. Through this partnership, you will have access to a network of more than 1,000 physicians and specialists offering expanded services, increased hours, and integrated care through a state-of-the-art electronic medical records system.\r\n\r\nYou will access these services in the same way you do now\u2014by making an appointment through SHS or, in the case of athletics-related concerns, through Sports Medicine at the Athletic Center. The vision is both to elevate the level of service we offer and to integrate student health and well-being across the College.\r\n\r\nIn SHS, we will have a full complement of dedicated HHC personnel. These staff will be able to call on the vast HHC network to refer you when necessary to local and regional specialists in a wide array of medical sub-disciplines.\r\n\r\nAthletic trainers and physicians from HHC will serve our student athletes, who will also be able to call on specialists, including orthopedic surgeons, sports medicine physicians, concussion experts, and cardiologists\u2014along with sports neurology services at HHC\u2019s Ayer Neuroscience Institute. Experts in sports nutrition, sports psychology, and athletic performance screening will be available to coaches and students as well.\r\n\r\nMost important for the fall, of course, when the College is investing additional resources to mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19, our new partnership with HHC will play an important role. Not only will HHC clinicians help us implement new COVID-19 protocols, but our health services staff will also be able to confer with HHC leaders in infectious disease and prevention as we seek to maintain the health of our general population.\r\n\r\nIn short, this partnership is designed to ensure that you have the care and support you need to be successful, both personally and academically.\r\n\r\nWe are especially grateful to Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Sarah Cardwell, Athletic Director Mo White, and Director of Student Counseling and Health Services Janet Spoltore for their impressive work over the last six months to develop this new inter-institutional collaboration. While their work began before COVID-19, it has become even more vital as we deal with the ongoing effects of a global pandemic.\r\n\r\nWe have worked very closely with HHC to facilitate a smooth transition over the summer. All of our existing clinical staff in SHS and athletic trainers in Sports Medicine were offered continuing employment with HHC. More information about the staff and operations of both of these departments will be available in August.\r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions, please feel free to reach out directly to Dean of Students Victor Arcelus. We look forward to a successful and healthy fall.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nVictor Arcelus\r\nDean of Students\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

{"prompt": ["Returning to Conn in Fall 2020"], "completion": "Returning to Conn in Fall 2020\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Students,\r\n\r\nI hope you are taking care of yourselves and, more importantly, taking the time to learn as much as you can at the start of this momentous summer. I am writing today with news of the College\u2019s plans for opening the campus in the fall. We will have much to do as a community when the semester begins, and so I want to express my gratitude to the many staff, faculty, and students whose hard work and good thinking have allowed us to get to this point.\r\n\r\nForemost on our minds, of course, is your health and safety. We are following guidance from the state of Connecticut, from public health officials, from alumni experts, and from colleagues at other colleges and universities to ensure a safe and productive semester.\r\n\r\nThat means the fall will not be typical. Public health guidelines, for example, call for social distancing and for using face coverings in public spaces to protect each other from infection. All of it will be an adjustment, to be sure, but I know you will rise to the challenge, because, in the end, that\u2019s what Camels do.\r\n\r\nWe have created a website, the Path Forward  , to provide answers to the questions you may have. Please review it carefully and often. We will update the site as soon as new information becomes available.\r\n\r\nFor now, I offer a summary of the work we have done around teaching, housing, dining, testing, and the Camels Care Pledge that we will be introducing later this summer.\r\n\r\nTeaching\r\nEarlier this month, the deans sent you a letter  explaining the new flexible course format for the fall, an approach that allows instruction to be delivered in both 7.5-week or 15-week periods with a hybrid of in-person and remote options. Classes will begin Sept. 1 and in-person instruction will end Nov. 21, with the remainder of the term, including final exams, conducted remotely. Information on the new course schedule and your registration dates will be sent to you later in July.\r\n\r\nClassrooms and public spaces across campus are being redesigned, as well, to allow for appropriate social distancing and to accommodate, where possible, new technologies for simultaneous in-person and remote instruction.\r\n\r\nHousing and Dining\r\nAs with classrooms, we are also rethinking our use of residential spaces to address public health concerns. Here, social distancing means not only limiting room occupancy but also providing appropriate space to isolate students who may test positive for the virus. This, too, requires careful planning.\r\n\r\nAnd it requires us to know more from you. Tomorrow, you will receive a separate email with the subject line Return to Conn Questionnaire. In it, you will find a link to a brief survey about your fall 2020 plans. We are asking all students in the Classes of 2021, 2022, and 2023 to complete the survey by 5 p.m. on June 29 so we can begin to implement our housing strategy with information about your plans for the fall. You will receive details about the housing selection/assignment process in early July.\r\n\r\nAs for dining, we are following the latest guidance on food preparation and service to create new options for the fall. These include: increasing the number of dining spaces on campus; reconfiguring seats in existing locations; adjusting our approaches to serving; and expanding takeout.\r\n\r\nMonitoring and Testing\r\nTo maintain a safe and healthy environment, we have also developed a robust program of testing and contact tracing for students, faculty, and staff. This goes well beyond the state guidance to provide even more peace of mind for you and the community. Again, you can find a detailed description of our plans on the Path Forward website  .\r\n\r\nCamels Care Pledge\r\nIn the end, our collective health and safety depends on the care and respect we have for each other. The Connecticut College honor code forms the basis for that care, and so, building on that foundation, we are asking everyone to sign the Camels Care Pledge, an acknowledgment of our shared individual and community responsibility to protect each other in the coming semester. Later in the summer you will receive the Camels Care Pledge and we will ask you to sign it and take it seriously.\r\n\r\nSo far, this letter has emphasized all the work we have undertaken to welcome you back to campus. But the point of the work is for you to have a vibrant, engaging, and productive semester of learning, filled with programs and activities and connections with faculty, with staff, and with each other. We want you, in short, to thrive as you pursue your own goals and, even more important, contribute to the flourishing of your friends and colleagues as they pursue theirs. That is the essence of our mission, and I feel confident that, with your help, we will make it happen.\r\n\r\nPlease send any questions you have about this letter or about the website to Fall2020SafeReturn@conncoll.edu  . Our deans will respond promptly. They will also be hosting a WebEx town hall event in July to speak to you directly.\r\n\r\nWe all look forward to welcoming you back in August.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

{"prompt": ["Our Commitment"], "completion": "Our Commitment\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Members of the Connecticut College Community,\r\n\r\nWe are living through an extraordinary moment in history. The senseless killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of white police and vigilantes have compelled people in every corner of the United States and around the world to take a stand against racism, and to demand the same of all our institutions. We have been deeply moved in the past week by the eloquent words of so many leaders, including our own students, faculty, staff, alumnae and alumni, calling on us to support black lives on campus, in our community, and in the world.\r\n\r\nThis historic moment will not reward bystanders. It calls for action. Action is at the heart of our mission at Connecticut College: to educate students to put the liberal arts into action as citizens of a global society. And so, informed by conversations we have had with many of you in recent days, we are writing to let you know the set of concrete actions the College is committed to taking in the 2020-21 academic year to advance anti-racist education.\r\n\r\nThe work will be based on the broad goals of our 2019 Equity and Inclusion Action Plan  , with ten commitments in three areas: campus safety and law enforcement; teaching and learning; and climate.\r\n\r\nAnti-Racist Education in Campus Safety and Law Enforcement\r\n* Responding to a growing national movement to transform the nature of policing, the College will review its own procedures for handling campus incidents in order to move the department of campus safety toward a more inclusive, community-oriented philosophy of intervention.\r\n* In the same vein, the College will engage our campus safety officers in a set of conversations about implicit bias, racial profiling, and how to counteract them.\r\n* New London Mayor Michael Passero \u201979 will, in turn, establish a community task force to review the policies, procedures, and training in the New London Police Department related to de-escalation, racial bias, and use of force. Two representatives from Connecticut College\u2014John McKnight, dean of institutional equity and inclusion, and Mary Savage, director of campus safety and emergency operations\u2014will serve on the task force.\r\n* We will also expand on the very successful series, Conversations on Race  , launched last year in partnership with The Day and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, to explore racial bias in policing as well as other themes.\r\n\r\nAnti-Racist Education in Teaching and Learning\r\n* To address one of the first goals of our Equity and Inclusion Action Plan, we will require all members of the Connecticut College community to complete an online program that offers foundational training around questions of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This online instruction is meant to be just the first step in a much larger effort to promote advanced dialogue and understanding across difference.\r\n* We will launch a new graduation requirement, starting with the Class of 2024, on Social Difference and Power  , a requirement ratified by the faculty in spring 2019. We are grateful to Professors Deborah Eastman and Sufia Uddin for their leadership in developing this requirement and for the many faculty who will offer courses.\r\n* Likewise, we will refocus the diversity portion of new student orientation, again starting with the Class of 2024, to include a more intentional focus on combating interpersonal racism within the campus community.\r\n* And we will create a continually updated guide of opportunities and resources to promote anti-racist education. We have been inspired by the statements of support and solidarity by many departments, programs, and groups, which have included links to educational resources, for example: from our student leaders  ; from a group of faculty and staff  allies; from the faculty in the Psychology Department  ; and from staff in Student Counseling Services  . These educational resources will be compiled into a single comprehensive guide on the Office of Institutional Equity and Inclusion website  for the campus community.\r\n\r\nAnti-Racism and Campus Climate\r\n* During the 2020-21 academic year, we will administer the planned-for campus climate survey  by the national Higher Education Data Sharing Consortium, which COVID-19 forced us to postpone this spring. Data from the survey will be used to inform future plans.\r\n* And we will work to amplify and enhance the College\u2019s bias response protocol to incorporate restorative justice approaches in keeping with best practices nationally.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many additional courses, lectures, programs, and actions being planned for the coming year by our centers and departments that will address many of the same themes. You may learn more on this calendar  .\r\n\r\nWe believe that all this work will advance, in a rigorous way, the goals and objectives articulated in our Equity and Inclusion Action Plan\u2014a plan that has been built on a long history of activism at Connecticut College. A full report of our progress on the Action Plan will be published on the President\u2019s website  this month and updated during the year.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want you to know that we have prioritized equity and inclusion in the College\u2019s comprehensive fundraising campaign with a goal to raise at least $5 million to support capital projects and programming. Here, too, we have made progress. In 2018, a gift from a generous alumnus provided the seed funding for us to begin designing our strategy. Last year, a generous alumnus donated $500,000 to help us bring a second cohort of Posse scholars from New York City to join our scholars from Chicago. And another gift of $1 million from Agnes Gund \u201960 allowed us to endow The Dialogue Project  , a comprehensive social justice education program that is already making an impact.\r\n\r\nWe know the road to justice and equity is long, but we hope that, with these concrete actions, our community will move a bit closer to realizing the values we profess. The College is committed to using resources in the best possible way to continue advancing this important work with you. As always, we thank you for your support and look forward to the results of our collective commitment.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine Bergeron, President\r\nVictor Arcelus, Dean of Students\r\nJeff Cole, Dean of the Faculty\r\nPamela Dumas Serfes, Vice President for Communications\r\nW. Lee Hisle, Vice President for Information Services\r\nRich Madonna, Vice President for Finance and Administration\r\nJohn McKnight, Dean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion\r\nCheryl Miller, Vice President for Human Resources and Organizational Development\r\nJefferson Singer, Dean of the College\r\nAndy Strickler, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid\r\nKim Verstandig, Vice President for Advancement\r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

Our thoughts are with the people of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Boston, and other cities around the country protesting racial violence and police brutality, including the tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. We are deeply saddened by these incidents and write today to express our solidarity with communities of color and all who are mourning.\r\n\r\nIn challenging times, we come together as a community. We cannot convene in person now, but we would like to do so remotely in order to reflect on this moment. Earlier this year, our Office of Religious and Spiritual Programs created PAUSE for that very purpose\u2013a time for prayer, poetry, silence, and solidarity.

{"prompt": ["News from the May 2020 Board of Trustees Meeting"], "completion": "News from the May 2020 Board of Trustees Meeting\r\n\r\nA Message from the President\r\n\r\nDear Members of the College Community,\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut College Board of Trustees convened for its spring meeting via Webex on May 15 and 16. The College\u2019s response to COVID-19 was the focus of the plenary session and of every committee meeting as well. Other topics included our six-year graduation rate; Title IX; faculty promotions; capital projects; College finances; and fundraising. This letter summarizes points discussed and actions taken.\r\n\r\nRepopulating the Campus: Health, Safety, and Financial Considerations\r\nFriday\u2019s plenary session centered on our efforts to enable a safe and healthy fall 2020. Dean of Students Victor Arcelus presented the latest state guidelines as a framework for the College\u2019s phased approach to reopening in August. Dean of the Faculty Jeffrey Cole reviewed ongoing discussions of the academic calendar and social distancing measures in classrooms. Trustees discussed progress on testing, redesign of community spaces and residence halls; PPE; and visitor and event protocols. Vice President for Finance and Administration Rich Madonna described the financial impacts of different scenarios as well as key decision points in the College\u2019s planning, which will continue through summer.\r\n\r\nAcademic Affairs and the Student Experience\r\nThe Committee on Academic Affairs discussed recent departmental reviews, lessons learned from remote teaching, the online course pilot for Conn students this summer, and alternative calendars for 2020-21. Vice President for Information Services Lee Hisle also shared the results of the biennial Measuring Information Services Organization  survey, showing high levels of satisfaction with IS services from students, faculty, and staff.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Student Experience focused on COVID-19 planning, Title IX, the College\u2019s six-year graduation rate, and the results of a survey on remote learning, which found that students overwhelmingly preferred face-to-face over remote instruction. Dean of Students Victor Arcelus reviewed in more detail the College\u2019s arrangements for testing, contact tracing, and housing in the wake of COVID-19, as well as partnerships with local healthcare providers to strengthen our campus health network. Dean of Institutional Equity and Inclusion John McKnight discussed equity concerns raised by the pandemic in the areas of mental health, wellness, and digital access, and also reviewed the new Title IX regulations recently released by the U.S. Department of Education. Finally, Dean of the College Jefferson Singer presented a comparative peer analysis of six-year graduation rates, showing Conn\u2019s strength relative to the cohort. With first-to-second year retention having improved for the classes of\r\n2018 and 2019, our six-year graduation rate is on track to achieve even better outcomes in the coming years.\r\n\r\nFacilities and Infrastructure\r\nThe Facilities and Infrastructure Committee discussed new pandemic work requirements, including campus health and safety; regulatory compliance; cleaning and disinfecting protocols; social distancing in classrooms, dining, and social spaces. While most capital projects remain on hold, the renovation of Palmer Auditorium is moving forward, with bidding completed and a general contractor identified. Construction is slated to begin in June, as more Connecticut businesses reopen. The Board also reviewed, with enthusiasm, a landscape renewal project being undertaken at the waterfront by Conn's facilities staff while students and coaches are away from campus.\r\n\r\nTrustees met with members of the Information Services team to discuss remote learning and IS objectives for the coming year. Lee Hisle reported on a recently completed cybersecurity assessment and a security camera installation, providing new and updated equipment across campus.\r\n\r\nFinances and Fundraising\r\nThe Finance Committee, meeting weekly with the senior administration since late February, continued its analysis of budget impacts related to COVID-19. Through budget and workforce reductions the cash operating budget is expected to balance this fiscal year, but significant revenue shortfalls are projected for fiscal 2021, related to likely changes in enrollment, fundraising, and financial aid. With the deposit deadline for the Class of 2024 postponed, trustees will approve the budget for FY 2021 later in June. New marketing strategies to engage prospective and admitted students were discussed, along with the launch of a new admission campaign and plans to reduce summer melt.\r\n\r\nIn the area of fundraising, the Connecticut College Fund, which has raised $5.3 million in gifts and pledges, is on track to finish strong this year. In the third year of its silent phase, the campaign is making steady progress as well, reaching $125.5 million. A bequest of $540,000 from the estate of the late Ann Shields Koepfli \u201947 was formally accepted by the Board for inclusion in the Connecticut College endowment.\r\n\r\nThe College participated in a global giving challenge on Tuesday, May 5, which raised more than $230,000 from nearly 500 donors. We will launch a second Camel challenge, Stronger Together, on June 1 to 3 with a $250,000 matching grant donated by generous trustees. The Board was excited about the June launch of Conn\u2019s new online alumni community\u2014the CONNector\u2014offering information on career and internship opportunities, mentoring, affinity groups, and alumni events.\r\n\r\nAppointments, Promotions, and Departures\r\nAs is the custom each May, the trustees reviewed the faculty staffing plan and approved recent promotions. In light of the financial challenges brought on by COVID-19, the Dean of the Faculty explained that there will be no tenure-track searches in the coming year. A number of faculty, however, received promotions. Purba Mukerji  was elevated to full professor; Loren Marulis , Michelle Neely-Yates , and Michel Seifert  achieved the rank of associate professor with tenure; and Jillian Marshall  and Emily Tarsis  were promoted to senior lecturer. The Board extends its congratulations to all these exemplary teacher-scholars.\r\n\r\nThe Board made appointments of its own, voting in seven new trustees for terms beginning July 1: Maria Boyce \u201985, Ethan Brown \u201994, Gregory Gigliotti \u201988, and Steven Jacobson \u201985 P\u201922 will join the Board for the first time; Jonathan McBride \u201992 and Pamela Zilly \u201975 will return to the Board for new terms of service; and Shyanne Temple \u201920 will begin as Young Alumni Trustee. Seth W. Alvord \u201993 was reappointed for a second, four-year term, and Karen Quint \u201987 was elected as vice chair.\r\n\r\nFinally, five members of the Board were honored with tributes for their distinctive contributions to Connecticut College: Bradford T. Brown P\u201912 \u201915 \u201920, Sally Fenton \u201963, Mark Iger \u201975, Annie Scott \u201984, and Maurice Tiner \u201917 will end their service on June 30. The Board also presented a special resolution to Bonnie Wells, Secretary of the College, in honor of her retirement.\r\n\r\nOther Business\r\nOur first virtual major Board meeting culminated with a first-ever virtual graduation event  , a live broadcast featuring remarks from Founder and President of Ashesi University Patrick Awuah, tributes to and from the Class of 2020, and a special remote performance of the R&B alma mater  with students, faculty, and staff. The celebration received positive feedback from seniors, parents, families, alumni, and many of you. The Class of 2020 will reconvene on Memorial Day weekend 2021 for their in-person celebration.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nKatherine\r\n\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

In my letter of April 15  , I discussed the working groups we had formed to determine how and when Conn will resume classes next year. I am writing today to let you know about our progress.\r\n\r\nTo put it plainly: our aim is a successful start of school in the fall. You know our mission at Connecticut College: to put the liberal arts into action. That means thoughtful interactions with professors and students; rigorous coursework; research and leadership; artistic, athletic, and community engagements; and, above all, real-world experiences in a generous and respectful residential community. We are committed to realizing that mission in 2020-2021.\r\n\r\nOne of the \u201creal-world\u201d experiences we all will face, of course, is adapting our lives and work to new public health protocols. Protecting the health and safety of the community will always be our highest priority. We are now working through various logistics to ensure a strong and safe fall semester for everyone. You can expect to hear more detailed plans by the end of this month.\r\n\r\nFinally, with a tight job market, we suspect that some of you may be looking to advance your academic goals this summer. You should know that, starting in July, Connecticut College will be making a special group of courses available to you online. More information about the course topics, professors, registration, and cost will be posted on or before June 1.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we are sending good thoughts your way as you complete this historic spring semester. We very much look forward to having you back on campus.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

And if there is one thing I know for certain in this very uncertain time it is how much I miss you all. I hope you are taking care to stay healthy and strong.\r\n\r\nI am writing today to let you know about the steps we are taking to continue addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Early in March we established a set of three working groups\u2014on academic, student life, and business continuity\u2014to anticipate and to tackle the myriad disruptions brought on by the pandemic. The purpose of these groups has been to evaluate the issues and to make timely decisions to ensure the health of the campus and the continuity of academic, campus life, and business operations.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the first phase of that work focused on immediate matters related to flattening the contagion curve: moving you safely off campus; shifting faculty and staff to remote teaching and teleworking arrangements; and adjusting the on-campus workforce in response to a reduced student body, canceled programs, and government orders.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the second phase, focused on plans for the future, including summer and fall academic programs; calendar options for a healthy fall; and post-pandemic financial sustainability. Members of the senior administration are co-chairing the students, faculty, and staff on each group to connect the range of issues being addressed. All groups are charged with working in coordination with campus leadership, local health authorities, external advisory groups, colleagues across the NESCAC\u2014and especially with each other\u2014to ensure the strongest vantage point for decision-making.\r\n\r\nBelow you will find the groups\u2019 charges and membership. I invite you to share ideas directly with the members by using the google forms linked below. Thank you in advance for your involvement.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on the ways that you have already responded to the crisis, I have been moved by your equity-mindedness, your hard work, and your openness to change. These are traits that have defined the character of Connecticut College from the beginning. The impressive, collective actions of our community in the past weeks go further: they reveal our nimbleness and strength as a College, qualities that I know will help us persist through this crisis and emerge stronger in the future.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nKatherine\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nWorking Group on Academic Continuity\r\nThis group is focused on the continuity of summer and fall academic programs both on and off campus. First and most importantly, the group is considering a variety of scenarios for a healthy reopening of the campus in fall 2020 and spring 2021, including potential adjustments to our academic calendar and models that feature both residential and remote instruction. In concert with the fall academic program, the group is making recommendations about the viability of college-sponsored travel in the fall, including study away programs and international conferences. Summer programs under consideration include those associated with the Summer Science Research Institute, the Child Development Lab School, athletics and arts camps, as well as internships and college-funded fellowships. The group is also exploring a possible pilot of online summer courses for our own students\u2014with the aspiration of offering limited online courses during future summer and winter breaks.\r\n\r\nUse this form  to contact the Academic Continuity working group, whose members include:\r\nJeffrey Cole, Jefferson Singer, co-chairs; Anne Bernhard, Amy Dooling, Danielle Egan, Karen Gonzalez Rice, Heidi Henderson, W.

In coordination with the academic and business continuity groups, the campus life group is evaluating implications of each calendar scenario on key areas of the student experience. Such areas include: community health and wellness, housing, dining, athletics, New Student Orientation, student engagement, equity, and inclusion.

The long-range uncertainties caused by the coronavirus have unfortunately made it necessary for us to postpone the public ceremony of College\u2019s 102nd Commencement, scheduled for May 17. Our new plan is to hold that ceremony next year, on May 30, 2021, during Memorial Day weekend.\r\n\r\nI wanted you to have this announcement because you may receive questions from seniors who received it earlier today. The change of plans represents, of course, a great loss for everyone. But the public health risks left us no choice. A special remote event is now being planned to recognize our graduates on their originally scheduled date of May 17. You will be hearing more about this in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nOur schedule for Reunion has been similarly revised. Reunion classes received their own announcement today about the postponement of Reunion 2020 to June 2021.

Mariateresa was known to many on campus for her dedication to the College and for her warmth and positivity.\r\n\r\nBorn in Lamezia Terme, Italy, Mariateresa moved to New London at age 15 with her family. She graduated from New London High School and lived in the city until her death. She joined Connecticut College in 2010 as an on-call custodian and was promoted twice\u2014to custodian in 2012 and to custodial work leader in 2015. Her most recent appointment was in Branford House and, before that, she oversaw custodial operations in Abbey, Plant, Blackstone, Larrabbe, and Smith-Burdick houses. She also worked for a time in Fanning Hall.\r\n\r\nMariateresa was an engaged presence on campus, serving as a member of Staff Council from 2017 to 2019. Her daughter Angela Pezzello told us that her mother often spoke warmly about the College and its close-knit community of students, staff, and faculty. The family regularly attended events on campus at the LGBTQIA Center and in Sprout Garden. A single mother of four daughters, Mariateresa was an expert cook, specializing in homemade gnocchi, eggplant parmesan, and Italian Christmas cookies, which she generously shared with her friends and colleagues on campus. She was also an avid gardener who cultivated beautiful flowers and vegetables. She was greatly admired for her positive life force and the influence she had on others.\r\n\r\nCalling hours will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 2, at the Impellitteri-Malia Funeral Home, 84 Montauk Ave., New London. A Mass of Christian burial funeral will be held at 10 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 4, at St. Joseph Catholic Church, 149 Montauk Ave., New London. An obituary will be published on the funeral home website  on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in extending our deepest condolences to Mariateresa\u2019s daughters: Lucia, Sabrina, Angela, and Cristina Pezzello; her co-workers in the Office of Facilities Management; and her many friends on campus.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nKatherine Bergeron\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nOffice of the President ** 860-439-2666 \r\n\r\n** 270 Mohegan Avenue, New London, CT 06320 \r\n\r\n** View this email in your browser \r\n|   ** Update your preferences \r\n|   ** Unsubscribe \r\n\r\nThis email was sent to kchan@conncoll.edu \r\nwhy did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences \r\nConnecticut College - ADV, COMMS . 270 Mohegan Ave .

She will be on campus April 21.\r\n\r\nCash is an American music legend, a four-time Grammy award-winning artist with a career spanning over 40 years and including 15 albums and thousands of solo performances. She is also a writer and activist whose publications include a collection of stories and poems, Bodies of Water; an autobiographical memoir, Composed; and numerous essays and opinion pieces that have appeared in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, the Oxford-American, The Nation and many other venues.\r\n\r\nIn both her music and her prose, Cash has been one of country music\u2019s most outspoken advocates for ending gun violence in America. She has served on the board of directors of PAX, Real Solutions to Gun Violence, and has used her microphone strategically as a vehicle for addressing many forms of injustice. This orientation is evident in her most recent album, \u201cShe Remembers Everything,\u201d whose narrative arc conveys the depth of her courage, conviction, and her quiet audacity in speaking truth to power.\r\n\r\nCash\u2019s creative vision has benefited arts institutions across the country. She has served as an artist-in-residence or a programming adviser at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, San Francisco Jazz, the Minnesota Congress, and The Library of Congress. Among her many accolades, she was awarded the Screen Actors Guild\u2010American Federation of Television and Radio Artists Lifetime Achievement award for Sound Recordings in 2012; in 2014, she received the Smithsonian Ingenuity Award in the Performing Arts; and, in 2015, she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters\u2019 Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nHer visit on April 21 will include formal and informal discussions with students, faculty and staff during the day and a reception and a book/CD signing in Evans Hall in the evening. The main event, at 7 p.m. will be an on-stage interview with Cash about the many facets of her career. Please mark your calendars.
